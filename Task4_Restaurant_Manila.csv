Over Christmas my wife and I were in Manila visiting family. My brother-in-law took us to The Sky Deck View Bar. OMG, a 360 view of Makati which really sets the atmosphere for a good time. Lots of expatriates there and everyone was having a great time. We stayed there about three hours enjoying great cocktails and good food. I felt right at home there and the patrons were very sociable. Around 11:30 we headed out for another bar but this place is on my permanent list of places to have fun!Tony

Sky Deck View Bar is very popular; it has a nice atmosphere and can get extremely busy.  It boasts a three hundred and sixty degree view of the city that is positively breathtaking!  I suggest you try to get there in time to enjoy the sunset, and then watch as the city lights come on.I've eaten here a couple of times.  The first time I had the Mahi Mahi, which was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful; the 2nd time I enjoyed a local shrimp dish that was also quite good.Service was great the first time, but really bad on the second visit.  That time the staff was completely disorganized - they forgot dishes, and brought everyone's dishes at different times in no discernable order.  At the end of the meal, it was impossible to get the check....Given the beauty of the venue and the quality of the food, I'll be back again, and hopefully they staff will have their acts together.

This sky deck offers arguably one of the best views of Manila, among them the iconic City Hall clock tower and the Manila Cathedral. It's great to stay here in the late afternoon on a clear day, when the city is awash in a golden glow, and also in the evening, when you see the city lights. During our dinner here, we even saw fireworks! Since we were checked in at the Bayleaf, we woke up early to catch the sunrise here. It was a cloudy day, though, so we didn't get to see much, but I imagine it must be perfect on a summer day. The nice thing about this is even people who are not guests of the hotel can visit. So those who just want to see Manila from above can do so here while having dinner or drinks.The food is nice - we shared a pizza here, but it was really the view that sold us. The colorful umbrellas are also a nice touch.

Oh sweet Jesus, the view. THE VIEW.Skydeck Lounge is an upscale bar lounge located at the Bayleaf hotel in Intramuros. It possibly has one of the best views in the entire metropolis, and since the building is in the middle of a heritage area, you know they'll have this view for a long, LONG time.The food is pretty good too, to be fair. Their Beef Salpicao is one of the best I've ever had, their Kesong Puti dip was savory and flavorful, and their Kare-Kare was both hearty and superb. But really, the main selling point of this lounge is that brilliant view. Come at night, so you can enjoy the night breeze while you dine with a special someone. Imagine yourself whispering sweet nothings at your partner's ear while sipping some wine and admiring the view. Unbeatable.

Rooftop bars in the city are few and far between. But recently, there has been a number popping up around the metro and one of those bars/restaurants with the best 360-degree view is the Sky Deck View Bar at The Bay Leaf inside the walled city of Intramuros. Without a doubt, an expansive view of Old Manila, with its historic buildings is hard to beat. On one end, you'll see the recently refurbished National Museum in all its resplendent glory. Close by is the magnificent Manila Post Office. With a turn of your head, the sprawling and well-kept Club Intramuros Golf Course will meet your gaze. With hands perched on the railings of the sky deck, one can't help but remember how beautiful this city really is. Since it's a bar, the place also serves a list of the usual cocktails and a food menu with a Filipino twist. The best time to visit the place would be thirty minutes before sundown, when the air is cool and the sun isn't so oppressive, just right about the time when day turns into dusk.

Great view but too bad the service is horrible! This is not my first time here, and I have always somehow been disappointed with the service. But this time, it was too much and I will definitely no be going back nor recommending this place to guests visiting. Service in venues like this is key. If treated disrespectfully and you feel unwelcome, it's definitely not worth it and it shows a bad image of the service in the Philippines to our friends from abroad.I had friends visiting from France (a groupe of 7) and after touring Intramuros, I decided to take them to this rooftop bar for a refreshment. After taking a long time to be seated because they were saying all the tables were reserved (although the place was empty), we finally got a table after telling them we would only have one drink and leave. They boys ordered beers and cocktails but us ladies were so thirsty we decided to order fresh fruit juices. YES I SAID FRESH so I asked the waiter what Fresh fruit juices they had. After naming a few, I decided to ordered a fresh mango juice and told the waiter not to add any sugar (they often add sugar to an already sweet fruit...). When my drink arrived at the table, I took a sip of it and knew right away it came from a can! Since before ordering I made sure he would only name the fresh juices, I called the waiter to tell him. After denying twice, he finally admitted it was from a can. Sorry... he actually said it was a mix of fresh fruit and a can!! Although I am sure it was 100% from a can. When I told him you can't say it's fresh when it's not, he took it back in an extremely rude way (which really shocked me and he even said ""Okay fine I'll change it then""). He then came back with a fresh mango juice mixed with lots of water... But I decided not to say anything since my guests were around and I could feel my blood boiling of anger. So best to take a step back and take a deep breath hehehe. I am half Filipino half French and I felt like he probably took me for a tourist by serving me canned mango juice without saying anything (sorry Buddy, I've lived longer in Asian then anywhere else!!). Anyway, I find it sad that this can happen and that people sell canned juices instead of the supposedly fresh ones. It does not taste the same and does not have the same health benefits!!After waiting a long time for our drinks to arrive, less than 5 minutes later they were already kicking us out! Needless to say there was no tip left and it is rare for me not to leave any. It is quite disappointing for a place like this to offer such service...

I can count with one hand how many time's I've been to Intamuros in the past year. It's not a really a place that I frequent being far from where I live. But when my friends who live in Manila told me about this great place at the top of The Bayleaf Hotel, I was too curious to let this pass. True enough, the Skydeck Lounge at The Baylead Hotel offers one of the best views in Manila. Its highest point offers a 360 degree view of Intramuros and all the glory that come with this heritage site. Plus, the restaurant offers excellent food choices. It's here where I tasted some of the best lengua that I have had in awhile. I'm pretty sure that the place is scorching hot during the day but I'm also curious how the restaurant looks like in the light. Will just have to stop by again to find out. Maybe stay until night time this time.

The view is absolutely fabulous, prices for someone from the u.s still fabulous, service is great, the time it takes to get to you? Ohhh. We were here on thanksgiving and got it on Christmas. Yup. That long. But would we be back? For sure!!! But at an earlier time. Music is on par with blues melodies and jazz. Glasses of wine is only available in red and white from the house, all other wines are bottles, cocktails are available as well. The view is worth it even if you just have a drink.

Being on the sky deck to look at the night view of Manila, with its golden glow so bright Conquistadors are ashamed to have existed.Sitting in a nice, windy, chilly night with some new Filipino friends you've made with some drinks watching the city glow is bromantic. Day or night, sitting up here will give you a gorgeous view of the city. There are comfortable sofas for your leisure to enjoy yourselves, and, as the locals have told me (and I indeed heed their words, thanks guys!) it is best to come shortly before the sun sets down for some happy hour deals.Either way, I think if you're visiting the Philippines, Manila to be precise, this is one of your must-go spots!","Frequently Asked Question:

The stuffed chicken relleno was scrumptious! It came with gravy drippings that made a perfect combination with the juiciness of the meat and the chorizo del bilbao mixed in. We ate this pleasant dish in a comfortable homely feel of a Filipino-Spanish ambiance, I felt like I time travelled. Moving to the dessert menu, my husband and I found a peculiar yet interesting dessert called Sampaguita ice cream. We were able to split this ice cream into two as it is two scoops per order. As I took the first spoonful of the ice cream. It was surprisingly piquant! A dessert with a refreshing flowery taste! The trip going there was worth it.

There are 2 Ilustrado venues in the same location. The restaurant and the café. My review is for the café It's a nice place for a late lunch in Intramuros. Located in a quiet alley, the café brings you back to the old Spanish era with its decor. The food is a mix of Spanish and Filipino dishes. The food is average and a little overpriced, but I enjoy the ambiance that is different from most places in Manila and the service is good.

I had a lot of downtime being in a pretty quiet town where my parents live so  I made sure to look up some places to eat at in the city on the day I would be back. A lot of the spots on the lists I found had such long waits and/or were fully booked weeks out. I landed back in Manila just in time for lunch. My cousin made a reservation first thing in the morning. His friend met us at the restaurant. We went straight to the Intramuros area right after I got picked up from the airport. Intramuros is a different vibe. We nearly missed the entrance to the restaurant cos the driveway looked like an entrance to a palace. My cousin's friend was already at the table when we got there. We placed our drink orders then followed up with the food choices after a few minutes. A mango shake is a must for me when I'm in the Philippines because their version of the fruit is by far the best imho. It's always the perfect sweetness. We ate family style. I let my cousin take over the food ordering. I was starving so I knew whatever showed up would get eaten. We nearly ate everything. We asked them to wrap up what was left of the paella and gave it to someone outside. It seemed a damn shame to waste it. We did however finish everything else. The pork belly was amazing. The sides it came with blew me away.

This restaurant is located in Intramuros and I absolutely love the history within the restaurant. My cousins and I came here at 10am on Saturday. We each ordered the Ilustrado tapa which was good. They provided a small order of rice with the dish so luckily I also ordered a calamari salad. I wanted some cold for dessert and they have homemade ice cream with distinctive flavors such as Sampaguita... yes, the flower. I asked kuya which one he recommended and of course it was Sampaguita. It literally taste like how you smell the flower, but at least I tried it. My cousin said it's ""lasang patay"" translation is ""tastes like death"" since Samaguitas are known for making leis, or synonymous to having them at wakes.

Food's just ok. Ambiance is very nice. Service is positively good. Our server Chito was great.

This place had great reviews on yelp so decided to go ahead and give it a try. I must say that customer service was superb. They were very attentive on your orders, efficient and very professional. The restaurant setting dates from the Spanish colonial times, you will notice it from the furnishings in its interiors as well as the facade of the building itself. We opted for lingua, sisig & (cows skin). It was my first time to try this delicacy and was so surprised how delicious it was!!! Even their steamed rice was to die for. They had good variety of desserts that I encourage you to try.

We came here for a group dinner to include various dignitaries and special guest from the United States. We were part of the business economic mission to establish and build relationships between San Diego and Philippines. This restaurant came highly recommended as we were in the heart of the Intramuros area. We were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and has a very nice ambiance. We had a pre-set menu to include:-Artisan Breads with Duck and Liver Pate and Butter-Paella Ilustrado-Adobong Bagnet with Taba ng Talangka Bacalao al Vizcania-Canonigo with Sabayon and Mangoes-Ilustrado Lemon Iced TeaEverything we had was good, although I would have preferred more customary Filipino food like pancit, sinigang, adobo... Rather the entrees we were served were more Spanish infused food. It was different, but the flavors were there. We had to order rice separately as the paella already had rice. I felt the portions were quite small, esp since we had a very large party.Nice restaurant, small portions and good flavors.

Came here after touring Fort Santiago, so we were hungry after being out in the heat. And the quality of the food did not disappoint. We ordered: 1. Paella-- super flavorful,  good portion size. Overall: delicious!2.Bagnet binagoongan (pork belly with shrimp paste? I guess that's the English translation?) --- BEST DISH EVER. I'm not a fan of pork belly bcoz I generally avoid eating fat.  But OMG, this dish was beyond amazing.  Flavorful, crispy & chewy, all at the same time! The bagoong added a savoury touch to it. 3. Tokwa't Baboy (tofu & pork belly) - also very good.  4. Full rack of ribs -- meaty and tasty.  Good choice if you're feeling for meat.  5. Sisig - it was good.  It was smothered in gravy,  which was different but made the dish unique and creamy. The dishes may appear small,  but they are very filling.  This was shared amongst 5 hungry adults and we were very full.  Price: higher than your average sit- down.  But definitely worth it!Drinks: had a dalandan daiquiri, which was on point.  Not too strong.  Good dalandan flavor.  Made just right.  Ambiance: nice decor.  Good service. But I did feel out of place in my shorts and runners.  But I was coming from a day of sightseeing & touring outdoors,  so whatever lol

My first visit to this place and we just happened to stumble upon it. I was looking for street food but being that it felt like 99 F outside, the cool aircon was worth the prices. The food was okay, not anything spectacular, but our wait staff (Rebs, I think) earned the 4 stars. I had the bangus and my wife had the bagnet. The bread disappointed because it was just too ordinary. Yet the mango, oh the sweet mango, why have I not had mango like this before. Time stopped when I tasted the pristine flavors that summed up the essence of this country. At a moment all was clear about the significance of this place.","Frequently Asked Question:

My Kitchen by Chef Chris may have a simple, unassuming name, but it's a culinary experience not to be missed!  The food is delicious, the ambiance is outstanding, and the service is exceptional.The menu offers you choices from a wide variety of pizzas, pasta, freshly baked breads, desserts, and many other delectable dishes.  It's simply impossible to go wrong with anything you might choose here :-)Tip: Be sure to begin your dining experience here with ""The Original"" by Chef Chris; this is an uncommonly unique pizza preparation that involves rolling the pizza with alfla.

Learned about My Kitchen through a colleague in one of our ocular visit in Paco Park. It was an afternoon of spontaneity turned out to be a fine gastronomic adventure. It is an authentic Italian restuarant kept inside the Oasis Paco Park Hotel. Guests will pass through the hotel's pool area and the dining area is fixed with an open kitchen. The interiors is seemingly upscale. Price is a little steep but each serving is actually good for sharing. For the starter, tried the Special Chef's Salad (P590) grilled angus steak tossed with greens in sweet mustard dressing. The best-seller is the Panizza topped with five cheese, herbs, arugula and alfalfa. Ordered the Parma Panizza (P790) finished with ham slices, artichoke, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes. The texture is real crisp topped garnished with the freshest ingredients. My pasta of choice is the Penne Roberto (P720). The combination of gorgonzola cheese in cream works well. Grilled chicken, herbs, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomato is a palatable complement. Finished the meal with a cup of homemade gelato in Pistachio flavor (P125). Not to sweet, just the right amount of sugar. Great food and amazing service. The only inconvenience is the street parking.

Last Sunday my friend asked me to be her ninang at her confirmation at the San Miguel church in Malacanang. After the endless sermon by the priest, it was already lunchtime and me and the barangay of fellow ninangs and ninongs were hungry. My first and oldest inaanak (at 25) decided to treat us all to My Kitchen by Chef Chris. I've actually never heard about it before so I was initially dubious about the choice of restaurant. Somewhere in Paco? Okay. Apparently, it's The Oasis Hotel's restaurant. Going in, it didn't scream super fancy. In fact, the interior seemed dated and the area was not well ventilated. Judgments aside, I tried the food with an open mind. It was amazing! This is how the panizza should have tasted like when I went over to C's in Pampanga. I loved the Tinlou which had bacon, mushrooms and onions. And also the Paco one. Texture was perfect and taste was perfectly balanced. We also ordered the bolognese and the roast chicken. I liked the panizzas the best. For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I also loved it. It wasn't too creamy or too heavy, but it was dense enough to be satisfying. The lime provided a great contrast to the sweetness of the cheesecake.I'd definitely go back, but it's so FAR!

About the place: Really nice once you get in, but not in the best part of Manila. We read about it on Trip Advisor and YES it lives up to the hype. It seems to be in the bottom of a hotel, I think the Oasis Hotel or something. We are in Mandaluyong and it took about 40 minutes by Uber but again so worth it. About the food: Best Italian food I've ever had. I got the Spaghetti Carbonara - it says ""the oasis way"" and I asked what that meant and the waitress said very cheesy. I didn't think the cheese was overwhelming I though it was perfect. Great bacon and mushrooms also and the sauce was amaze. Do yourself a favor and order a side of grilled chicken to go with it. I was craving extra protein and honestly though it would be plain chicken - oh no - so delicious. Seasoned with I don't even know but so good! My boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan which was also delish. They brought bread put in the beginning that was very good and we ordered mozzarella sticks which were like crispy spring rolls filled with cheese and tomato dipping sauce. YUM!! We ordered tiramisu for dessert but we were too stuffed so brought it home for later...oh and leftovers, you will have them. Don't miss this gem in a rough part of town!!!

One of the best pizza places in the Metro is My Kitchen by Chef Chris. While not sporting the best of names, My Kitchen is home to the panizza, the brainchild and pride and joy of Chef Chris. Basically, it's a rectangular pizza cut into long strips that you may drizzle with oil and alfalfa, after which you roll it and eat to your heart's content. It's a nice change of pace from the 'regular' way of eating pizza we've grown accustomed to. They've perfected the right consistency of the dough - too hard and it won't roll, too soft it will break down. The best thing about going here is to go as a group. You can try the many flavors of pizza they have, as well as other entrees from the menu. The only thing I don't like about My Kitchen is the location. It's far and traffic is bad going there. But otherwise, they're all aces.

What a fantastic find this restaurant was! It was the attached restaurant of the Omni hotel right in the middle of Paco, a district of Manila. The food was delicious especially the rolled pizza accompanied with arugula & the chef""s salad with with potatoes, capers, olives, eggs, tomatoes. What a rare find in the middle of Paco close to Paco Park. I will return!

Raina and I braved the traffic of Manila and was relieved to be greeted by the warm and welcoming smile of the friendly staff with an inviting pool in the background of The Oasis, but we weren't there to go for a dip--except for Raina. Instead, we were there for My Kitchen at the Oasis Paco Hotel formerly Barramundi Restaurant.We showed up because we heard that this sublime deli in an oasis is the new home of The Original, previously known as the popular Panizza back when Chef Chris Locher Consultant Executive Chef for Aura Hotels and Resorts was in C! Restaurant in Pampanga.Located at The Oasis Paco Park Hotel (beside Paco Church near Old Swiss Inn), My Kitchen is Chef Chris' passion project where he fully expresses his enthusiasm for cooking intentionally leaving us wanting more of his delectable delights.The Caesar Salad (PHP 490) is made with romaine hearts dressed with their classic garlic and anchovy dressing, topped with parmesan cheese, bacon bits and freshly baked croutons.The Risotto Fruti Di Mare (PHP 890) is made with classic fish and seafood risotto with salmon, mahi mahi, shrimp and imported mussel enhanced with tomato, parmesan cheese, butter and saffron. This was everyone's favorite!The Linguini Vongole is a blend of fresh mussels sauteed in virgin olive oil, tomato and capers, topped with shredded parmesan. Mamma mia!We paired The Original Panizza (PHP 790) with a glass of Merlot. It is made with a fine crisp dough layered with a blend of five cheese and herbs, served with a bowl of arugula and alfalfa, perfected with their popular toppings: herbed chicken fillet, smoked bacon, portabella and golden mushrooms, capers, and slices of Kalamata olives.Their Fennel Crusted Salmon Fillet with Pesto Sauce (PHP 790) is bedded with slightly dry mashed potatoes, assorted fresh herbs, and Chinese spinach.To mark a sweet end, My Kitchen served us their homemade ice cream: Blueberry, Chocolate, Coffee and Rum Raisin. Rum Raisin rocked!

Fantastic! I was skeptical at first but the other reviews convinced me to give it a try - I wasn't disappointed. From a unique appetizer (pizza-like flatbread of the owners own creation), to onion soup, peaking with juicy and flavorful chicken, then winding down with a typical (but still good) tiramisu and cappuccino; Chef Chris and his staff have a lot to offer the Italian-cravers palate. Service was very attentive and friendly, but a bit slow on the wine pours. I enjoyed the ambience but I might recommend not facing the windows to the pool if you're not up to some awkward ""visuals"" as you eat your meal. Great dinner - thank you Chef Chris!

My Kitchen by Chef Chris is situated in a discreet (somewhat shady) area in Paco, Manila. Among all the dishes, the ultimate must-try is their Saint Jacques panizza. It's an off-menu dish which makes it even cooler! Lol. The risotto valentino was pretty good but only if you love bacon. The spaghetti con frutti de mare was also quite nice. I appreciated the generous serving of seafood. The mozzarella sticks were okay, but the mushrooms that went with it were heavenly!

Week Day Lunch for just over CAD$65 (2700 pesos), I would definitely say it is worth every penny.  Buffet is spread over a large dining area with separate stations for major cuisines from around the world.  Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Italian,  American, Mexican, Mediterranean,  Burger, Wings, Wraps, Sushi, Pizza, Pasta, Variety of International Cheeses, Fresh Oysters, Seafood section, Carving station, Variety of Salads and most of all my favorite a Huge Desert section.  Well laid out buffet with beautiful presentation.  Those cute little individual portions of appetizers & desserts in shot glasses and Chinese porcelain spoons are not only delicious, they are eye-pleasing.   Serving staff are so attentive, you feel like you have your own dedicated staff just to serve you and your guests.  During our lunch, never our glasses were neither empty nor single dirty plate on the table. Our glasses were constantly filled and plates were removed as soon as they are done. Restaurant hostesses at the front of the house were reminded me of Air Hostesses of 70s, classic, elegant, sophisticated. I can keep going on and on, but to summarize in one word, Café Ilang Ilang is ""Exquisite"".

Cafe Ilang-Ilang in Manila offers a decent variety of dishes. Still, its location could be more convenient for me as it is quite far from where I am usually located. Additionally, some of the food I tried was not to my liking as it lacked flavor and seemed poorly prepared. Or maybe, my bad that I did not try other foods due to my diet regimen.The seating process could have been faster, which resulted in a long wait before being seated. Once seated, the staff was friendly and accommodating. However, the food presentation was lackluster, and the taste was average at best.On the positive side, the cafe has a pleasant ambiance with a cozy and comfortable interior. The outdoor seating area is a nice touch, providing a relaxing atmosphere for customers.Overall, while Cafe Ilang-Ilang has potential, improvements in food quality, preparation, and seating process are needed to provide a better customer experience.

I encouraged my mom to go there for her birthday on 4/29 and she did.  While she said the food and service were good, she and two other people who went with her for lunch ended up with stomach ailments later that day.  My mom had a bad stomachache, my sister threw up her lunch, and their driver had the runs.  In this case, I'll give this place one star.

High priced buffet with a lot of choices but unfortunately does not hit the spot for me.- table was in a dark and cold spot of the dining area. - food was sub par Only a few choices were good like the wagyu If it were cheaper it would be better but for the price they should have better quality

This buffet is incredible. We went to the seafood buffet which they feature on Fridays. There were separate stations for different cuisines plus one for dessert alone. It was crowded but food was plentiful even up to late. Staff is polite and efficient.

Fantastic Buffet in a Grand Old Setting.  One of the most historic places in the city...Presidents have dined here, celebrities, and even General MacArthur lived here!Large selection of local favorites on the buffet.  Some of the food did not seem to be tasty but it could be my preference.Good cheese spread, decent carving station. Good deserts some are Americanized and some are traditional. Many choices, reasonable price. Make sure you ask the staff in the lobby to show you the war room.  It is loaded with pictures and memorabilia, but its not part of the usual tour.

Perhaps Cafe Ilang-Ilang is one of the most underrated hotel buffet options in the Metro. Despite so, it's definitely one of my favorites for several reasons:1. They serve quality food. Have you tried their seafood and meat options. Divine. Everything they cook is cooked to perfection. They are also willing to customize ever dish to your liking. 2. The seating area is all well-planned. You know how intrusive it is to hear the chatter from the next table? Cafe Ilang-Ilang's interior design makes it very easy for groups to enjoy their privacy while enjoying their meals. 3. Service staff is excellent. They refill waters the moment you need it and take away used plates as soon as you finish your last bite. They're efficient like that.

Cafe Ilang-Ilang's reasonably priced high-quality food definitely proves that good food does not always have to be expensive.

Best hotel buffet in Manila. There are only two types of food here: ""masarap"" (delicious) and ""napakasarap"" (super delicious).

I've noticed that buffet foods in hotels are slowly losing their quality. From poor selections to just average-tasting food, most hotels nowadays charge too much for meals that are bland and poorly made. An exception to this is Café Ilang Ilang in Manila Hotel. Café Ilang Ilang has a wide variety of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Filipino food. With the amount of food laid out in front of me, I had a hard time choosing what I would eat first. Their dessert buffet is excellent; they serve fresh fruits and freshly-baked pastries. Besides good food, the whole place has a nice setting and an accommodating service crew. It is surrounded by chestnut-colored chairs and couches and glass panels decorate every wall, emphasizing the restaurant's grandeur.  Café Ilang Ilang might not be the place for casual and spontaneous night outs, but I couldn't think of a better restaurant that offers good food and quality service.","Frequently Asked Question:

The restaurant has a lively and fun atmosphere, making it an ideal place for group gatherings or family meals.Overall, Samgyupsalamat is a great restaurant for Korean food lovers, with high-quality dishes and a pleasant ambiance. However, be prepared for a potentially long wait and higher prices compared to other Korean restaurants in the area.

If you're from the US and haven't tried Korean barbecue definitely check this place out. It's located in a upper scaled part of manila. We stayed about two blocks away in the Belmont Hotel and walked over. For about $10 per person us or 600 pesos all you can eat for 2 hours. We were only there for maybe an hour we tapped out. We didn't even eat the sides we only ate the meat and there was three of us and we could not do it. The place is nice and clean the staff is plenty quick to fill up your drinks any side you want and any additional meats you want.

My pork-eating days are behind me now, but when I used to enjoy all the porcine delights that the world can offer, my perfect idea of a hedonistic and devil-may-care indulgence is a slowly paced and savored Korean barbeque dinner. I used to live near Samgyupasalamat, which is an unassuming neighborhood joint that was put up to cater to the needs of the homesick Korean students who live in the condos and townhouses nearby. The TV screens always play K-POP, which adds to the bright and sunny interiors.

They were able to seat our group of 6 in under 30 mins! Great food and meat quality! It takes a bit to get your orders, but maybe it was just really busy that day. It was a packed restaurant when we went but we still had a great time. Definitely recommend, especially for tourists as the water and iced tea are made with filtered water and we didn't get any stomach bugs after drinking it!

It took us awhile to forgive Samgyupsalamat. At their Kapitan Tikong branch months ago, we were very unsatisfied with the tough meat they served us. We used to be regular customers there so we knew our meat.Our visit at this new branch redeemed us as regular customers again. We were so happy to be surprised by the extra space they have at the back; you'd think the branch is small if you only took a peek from the outside. It was a bit warm at first but they adjusted the aircon later on. Walls were painted black even in the restroom. Overall place looked simple and had that hole-in-the-wall vibe. Cleaning the front windows looks necessary though it amusingly matches the restaurant vibe.Service was good since they always got what we needed at fair waiting times. Refills came back loaded with food and the water pitcher really kept the service water cold.The free veggie leaves, dips, side dishes, steamed egg, and soup were impressive to the eyes and tongue. Be careful with the steamed egg because the bowl was insanely hot! We ordered two meats ala carte and they were excellent both in texture and flavor!To the management team:Thank you for impressing us, and we can only hope and wish you maintain the good quality of your food and service. Forget what I said about the windows; they still pass! :p

One trip to Taft is all it takes to get your bbq fix. Samgyupsalamat is as good as local restaurants we've tried in Seoul.

Ambiance: 3.5Mimicking Korean Restaurant is good however it can better if the smoke is handled. Yes, it is grilling most of the time but this one needz improvement as you'll end up teary  eyes.Food: 4.0Unlimited 1 - Pork Meat with 5 choicesUnlimited 2 - Pork and Beef Meat with 9 choicesSide Dishes (Banchan) are free and we love most the steamed egg (in earthenware bowl), Watercress Namul Mu Saengchae (but sweet Radish Salad), the braised sweet potatoes and the green onion spicy salad (i failed to get the name).Kimchi soup is good as well.Korean meats are  good. We had tried the 9 meats but got  2 odd with rate of 1/5, the bulgogi... (Not sure of the spelling) and thinned pork strips.Service: 5.0Quick responses and accommodating.Overall: 4.17 out 5.0

My pork-eating days are behind me now, but when I used to enjoy all the porcine delights that the world can offer, my perfect idea of a hedonistic and devil-may-care indulgence is a slowly paced and savored Korean barbeque dinner. I used to live near Samgyupasalamat, which is an unassuming neighborhood joint that was put up to cater to the needs of the homesick Korean students who live in the condos and townhouses nearby. The TV screens always play K-POP, which adds to the bright and sunny interiors. Their all-you-can-eat weekend Korean buffet constitutes unlimited servings of ban chan (Korean appetizesr), rice, cabbage and lettuce, and samgyupsal, or thin slices of pork that should be grilled on the spot. The staff are very helpful and they go out of their way to assist you with making sure that your bacon strips are grillled nicely.   I would go through plates and plates of the streaky bacon and pork loin, which I wrap in a lettuce leaf with a helping of rice, some kimchi, some gochujang and some salt and pepper.When I'm not indulging in their pork bufffet, their bibimbap is a fun and filling treat. Their pajeon, or ground pork and leek pancakes, area also the best, especially when dipped into their house soy sauce. I would cap each meal with a fish-shaped Binggrae ice cream sandwich, or with a bottle of soju, if I feel like a tipple.

A complete set of side dishes is served upon order of two main courses. Their daepae samgyupsal (sliced pork belly) is my favorite! Just make sure not to overcook it or else it will get tough. Beef boolgogi consists of chunks of Korean beef bbq marinated in sweet sauce. I suggest cooking the beef boolgogi last because its sauce remains in the grill and sticks to all the meat you cook afterwards. For a restaurant that caters mostly to students, I think the dishes are priced well (daepae samgyupsal is Php 240 and beef boolgogi is Php 290), except for the rice which is a whopping Php80 per cup.

This is a good spot to get some Korean style pork. The meat is fresh and the prices are very reasonable. They had an all you can eat option, but we decided on the ala carte instead. It ended up being cheaper and everyone got plenty of food. Some of the banchan was good. The kimchi could be better, but it wasn't bad either. If I had this meal even in Korea, I wouldn't be disappointed.","Frequently Asked Question:

?","We came for a late lunch, and left feeling satisfied. Like others have said, the seating is outside on the pier, which can be a little warm later in the day. Our ice melted quickly in our drinks. All in all, the portions are decent. Our part of two did leave with some left overs.Highlights: The Adobong Kangkong was cut into manageable pieces and was mixed into a delicious sauce. Lowlights: The pancit canton was made with ramen noodles. It was good, but it couldn't really be called pancit canton with the wrong noodles. Mixed bag: The Caldereta was sweet which my husband loved and I didn't, and our halo halo didn't have enough ice in them, even though they were tasty. I'm giving it a four nonetheless because I enjoyed the little Sheldon like seabird that kept us company. He wouldn't allow anyone on his log, chasing away a rude sparrow that dared to try to sit there.  Plus, the food was good, even if some of the ingredients were incorrect.

What I really loved on most restaurants is those who offer seafoods, and they all have it, foods are amazingly yummy and mouthwatering and most of the dishes are Filipino foods.

This place opens at 11 in the morning. It's next to the Ocean Park, It has a nice view of Manila bay and close to Luneta Park. They offer Filipino food especially seafood.A lot of people will say that it's pricey but they need to understand that the location of the restaurant plus labor is expensive so I understand why the price is the way it is. Also the portion size is good for two people.They don't have their own WiFi but there is a public WiFi that you can use to take pictures for Instagram. They also accept Credit and Debit Card.I'm giving it a 4 star review because there is still room for improvements.- Find a way to open earlier than 11 am.- Have your own WiFi exclusive for guest.- Work on presentation, because millennials like me like to post pictures on Instagram.- Few improvements with the servers and the service.- Improvements with online orders and delivery.Overall I will recommend this place for locals, foreigners and balikbayans.

Slightly pricey but the view is beautiful. I'm so glad Roxas boulevard was cleaned up, I used to ride a ferry here when I was younger.  Food was good but wet also knew what to order.

Good please for seafood. It's not trendy at all and have a good service. Crabs and shrimps are fresh and here they cook it in so many ways!

Quick facts - Don't think they accept cards. - You have to flag down wait staff like most places. - Good pictures - Offers non traditional Philippine food (grilled chez, fried chicken, etc), very accommodating of English speakers. ***they allow smoking in the dining area.*** Enjoyed this place a lot. It is literally over the harbor. The majority of the seating is on a pier reaching out over the water. This can give the place a bit of that unpleasant ocean smell, but you get used to it after a while and we didn't realize it within 20 minutes. There is literally a ton to choose from, which was the one time I felt bad about not knowing the language bc I could tell what I was missing out on.

Food was amazing! We ordered a lot of shrimp dishes and my allergies didn't react, meaning it's fresh (that's just my theory, hehe). Place is very clean and service was exceptional. Price is very reasonable too.

This place is a lousy value for what you pay.  It's an open-air restaurant on and over the water.  The decor and ambience is nothing special.  The service is so-so.  I ordered the wok-fried lapu-lapu with chili sauce.  The flavor was okay but out of a 500 gram fish, I got about 100 grams of meat and I had to work hard to get that much off this poor little fish's frame.  I had a side of steamed broccoli with garlic.  It was served swimming in a brown sauce and it was just too salty to eat.  For all of this, I paid PhP 1,600.  My curiosity has been satisfied and I won't be returning to this place.

We stumbled in to this place looking for another restaurant.  The food was tasty.  Unfortunately, the service was lackluster.  The ambiance is nice and the open air breeze was nice.  If you are not in a hurry, try this place out.

A go to for Filipino food.  Nice location on the water.  Wide selection of food, affordable, quick service.","Frequently Asked Question:

The food menu looks good reminds me of my local bar back in Canada. They even have a BBQ grill at the front. Only sad part was no running water to wash hands and washroom sucks, no toilet paper.

This bar is near and dear to us Peace Corps Volunteers. The staff is amazing and always ensuring every patron has a good time. The mixed drinks and beer never disappoint...and the overall ambiance makes for the perfect evening with friends Now I know Malate is not known for being the best area, but don't let the reputation deter you from truly enjoying the hidden gems located in the 'hood. Oarhouse is the place to be. One of their most popular cocktails is the fresh mango daiquiris. Absolutely amazing! You will find yourself committing to multiple orders of pitchers of these creeper drinks ;). The best part is it is only 350php for a large pitcher, which is the perfect thing to split if you're with a group. The place opens at 4pm so come early since the mango daiquiris run out rather quickly ;)!

This is my favorite pub/bar that I've ever been to here in Manila. The food is great and the staff are very accommodating, nice folk. It's great for when you just want to sit and talk or not talk and just sip on a beer.

Oarhouse Pub of Manila is a popular watering hole of local and foreign journalists in the Philippine capital. This is No. 1 on my bucket list when I visit Manila later this year. See you there!

It's a nice quiet bar mostly college crowd when I was there, beer prices good and it looks like they make their own brew. The food menu looks good reminds me of my local bar back in Canada. They even have a BBQ grill at the front. Only sad part was no running water to wash hands and washroom sucks, no toilet paper.

If it wasn't because of my friend's photo that was included in an exhibitat Oarhouse, I prolly wouldn't knew this place exists! Haha. Loser me.This 2-storey pub was adorned with antique picture frames, brick walls,in-can drinks, paintings, mirrored wall (which gave me an 80's barber shopfeels), old-fashioned bar stools, and a huge LCD tv. Something old, somethingnew. Something borrowed, something blue. One of their cornered walls wasdedicated to art exhibits and my friend was ecstatic to have her photo gotincluded on it. Yipee! :D Since I was with my photographer friend, we were ableto meet the humble owner of the pub, Mr Ben Razon, whose father was the one whostarted the famous Filipino-owned Razon's. We were all thrilled when wediscovered that my friend and Mr Razon both hailed in Pampanga. Yep, yep, smallworld! After the chat with the owner, I instantly felt at home. He shared thatPNoy's photographer was seated few tables away from us and from there I knewthat Oarhouse is a home of artists - true-blue or aspiring ones. And I'm surethe artists are glad that Oarhouse is there to showcase their talent.We were assisted by Evelyn who smiled at us sweetly like we were regulars.She was very accommodating and never missed our requests.This is the perfect place to chill after work; perfect place to catch upwith friends without shouting at each other because the music's volume was just right;if I were just living around the area this could've pass as my 3rd home, next tomy favorite coffee place. The food and drinks were affordable. The place wascentralized but you can smoke inside.We were billed around P600 for a pitcher of Amaretto Sour, plate ofNachos and few rounds of beer. Truly affordable!

Gotta love dumb luck! We ended up cancelling the Thai Island (Railey, Ko Samui, Ko Phi Phi) leg of our SE Asia trip due to monsoons and ended up with a 12-hour layover in Manila on the way to Boricay. After having dinner at an Aristocrat location and a few drinks at the now-defunct Shipyard around the corner, we ended up at this establishment. Little did we know how expat-friendly it was, or that Anthony Bourdain himself drank here during an episode of Parts Unknown! Quintessential neighborhood bar, right here. After a few San Miguels, we met some friendly (and gorgeous) Filipino medical students (Hey Julie). This made us decide it would be best to order a communal pitcher for all of us. Opted for the Weng Weng, which is essentially a more tropical Filipino Long Island. It was deadly, but delicious. Certainly made for a lovely evening. They also have other cocktail options and your standard San Miguel beer offerings, plus some local craft beer I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu. Most def the bar to hit up if you're an American in Manila. The bartender was incredibly welcoming and friendly, as well. Too bad they're Steelers fans...

It's an OK place but I would not say great. If.you need a rest from the surrounding area, then this would be a good place for that. the prices are decent and the staff is good. The reason I say not great because it is missing character. In fact, it seems more like a fast food place.","Frequently Asked Question:

The authentic shawarma recipe is what set them apart from other middle eastern restaurants. The price points is actually affordable with a wide range of menu to choose from.

See, I loooove falafels. I also happen to be vegan, so I love veggies.

I first encountered Shawarma Snack Center at the outskirts of BF Parañaque, during the height of the Shawarma Craze (For you millennials out there, that happened around the time most of you were born). Nowadays, there are a lot of middle eastern places in the city, and the offerings have become more diverse and authentic. Having said that, when I rediscovered SSC in Malate (It's the original one raw), it was like bumping into a long, lost friend. This time around, I ordered a combo keema plate for P250. It's borderline mahal for what you're getting, but it was pretty good and solid. I like the fact they have an aircon zone, but I avoided it because I didn't want to smell like the Mediterranean (Read: Meat). Still, I had a wonderful dinner over there, and I appreciate the fact I'm finding more and more reasons to hang out in Malate again.

This branch has the most extensive menu across all their other branches that I know of, and the only one I've been to that has FALAFELS. See, I loooove falafels. I also happen to be vegan, so I love veggies. Veggies you say? Falafels are super tasty fried balls made of chickpeas! A lot of my meat-eater friends actually thought falafels are meat! For Php 85 you can get a decent-sized falafel sandwich. This one is different from the other falafels I've had in the metro, since this one has pickled vegetables inside. Something new and tangy for my tastebuds, but still very satisfying. Their falafels are very flavorful (and a tad bit salty for my taste, but still tasty!). Great meal, heavy enough for lunch if I might say so. This branch also sells some middle-Eastern food products. Check out the shelf by the door! They have canned hummus!

Anytime I am in Malate, I make sure to get my Shawarma Snack Center fix. The place offers a laid-back ambiance where you can enjoy delicious food and hookah with friends. While they are known for their falafels and shawarma plates, which are delicious, the fresh fruit shakes are something to consider as well. My personal favorite is the green mango shake. Another great thing about this place is it is open 24 hours...so if you need something to soak up all the alcohol from your barhopping, this is the place to go ;).For those of you that enjoy a beer or alcoholic beverage with your meal, keep in mind that no alcohol is served here!

This restaurant took me back to the Middle East in a matter of minutes. From their slightly shabby interiors (not their strongest suit, in my opinion) to  every single bite I took from their food. I visited this place with my husband, who can be quite a snob when it comes to Middle Eastern restos in Manila (to be fair, he tasted a good number of shawarmas and hummus while living in the Middle East for six years). He ordered a plate of shawarma (that came with fries and some pickled veggies, so legit) while I ordered a full set of beef kebabs and rice. I was expecting him to make his usual snarky comment on the food like he did with the previous shawarmas that disappointed him, but he didn't. Instead, he ordered another plate. I downed my kebabs, btw. That plate was really big enough for sharing, but I was really hungry and the meat was really good. We paired our food with our chosen fruit shakes and there's just something about the way the Arabs make their shakes that's just so refreshing. I felt like I was eating in Lebanese Flower, my go-to place in Abu Dhabi. To say we were stuffed is definitely an understatement. We paid more than our usual lunch budget, but it was worth it. I can't wait to go to their BF branch soon.

Good place for middle eastern food. U know its good when arabs eat there. My only gripe was the waitress that broke a small glass that was pretty heavy on my wife shoulder. She never apologize and wife was very upset as she was in pain throughout the day.

I love their 3 shawarmas for 150 and their hummus too. I hate the chicken shawarma with rice. The chicken was too dry.I'll come back another time to try their other dishes.

Being a just a humble tourist in Manila, I have no idea how Shawarma Snack Center stacks up to its local competition. As someone whose international shawarma experience includes Istanbul, Moscow, Tbilisi, and my home state of CA, I feel like I can provide some helpful feedback. We were first a little confused which restaurant I had bookmarked. There's two Shawarma Snack Centers across the street from each other. One looks more sit-down restaurant-y, and the other caters to take-out and has a small air-conditioned room with plastic tables and chairs. We opted for the cheaper of the two and ordered a shawarma and kebab plate. The shawarma meat and wrap were both on the dry side and lacked the burst of flavor I'm accustomed to. The kebab wasn't much better, but it did have a little more flavor and came with rice. Portions reflect the name; closer to snack size. It was definitely an affordable meal and one of the cheapest we had in Manila. I'm not sure I'd come back the next time I'm in town unless I'm in this area and as it's open 24-hours, probably as a late-night snack. It looks like the restaurant SSC across the street is more promising with larger portions and more menu options.","Frequently Asked Question:

Czarra P.","If you're looking for an exclusive and classic Filipino food, this is the place to go. La Cocina de Tita Moning is stellar and in it's A game if we're talking about Filipino food! Right when you enter the house, the waitress offers you a complimentary lemongrass iced tea and grilled queso de bola bites on pieces of bread to tie you over for the house tour. House tour?! Yes! La Cocina de Tita Moning's is in an old house near Malacanang Palace therefore there is a tour guide to tell you all about the history and trivia about the Philippines especially during Marcos' time. The house is two floors and it's incredibly big. Each room was preserved including the things of the previous owners. But what else makes this restaurant so classy? Well, you have to reserve weeks before your actual date because many people fight for a slot on the reservation list! After the house tour, you are escorted to your table where you will be served a 5 course meal. The steamed lapu-lapu was the best. In fact, it was the best lapu-lapu I've ever eaten in my life. Then the egg plant with tomatoes were egg-cellent too! The paella valencianca had salted egg to it which added a very interesting Filipino twist to it. The roasted pork was so delicious also it wasn't dry and it didn't need much of the sauce because the meat itself was packed with taste already. Lastly the dessert, the bread pudding is something I could eat all day long! It was so saturated and soft that it melted in my mouth all at once. The calamansi tart was very interesting because it was sweet but sour. I also had a small cup of hot chocolate together with the vanilla ice cream which was of course, homemade. It was a wonderful experience here! It's worth saving up for, for sure!

A stone's throw away from Malacañang is one of the city's best-kept dining experiences, La Cocina de Tita Moning. Housed in an old, Spanish-style ancestral home is a fine-dining experience like no other. Once you enter the mansion, guests are offered a tour around the house and one can't help but imagine the grand parties that took place in those hallowed halls many decades before. I couldn't help but be fascinated by the objects in the rooms that we visited. One room was filled with hospital instruments and even a skeleton, revealing the fact that the master of the house was a doctor. Another room, filled with vintage cameras of all kinds showed that he was also a shutterbug. The living rooms of the place still had magnificence to them and I wished to have experienced the place in its heyday, even for just a little bit. We were then led to a private room where we had a sampling of Spanish-style dishes that were served in the days of yore. They were made even more delicious by the history that each bite contained.

Nothing speaks of good food like eating in someone's home, you get the best tasting and prepared with the most love dishes you won't find anywhere else! In the middle of, no less than, the Malacanang Compound you'll find Cosina de Tita Moning. This heritage house owned by the Legardas will treat you the best dishes while stepping back in time. You'll have to reserve yourself a table before making a visit, it's great for family celebrations or romantic dinners! The dinner usually starts in their garden with cocktails and pica-pica, the atmosphere is so refreshing you wouldn't believe that the main attraction hasn't even started. This house turned restaurant is also a museum, so a guided tour usually comes next, you'll find a nice library, old ternos, even a skeleton! The house holds stories from many generations back! When you finally get to your table the dinner is usually carefully plated and served in courses. Besides being so overwhelmed  with the whole experience, the food is actually very delicious! The service here is also very on point, with no one other than the family's help serving you, they really treat you like family! It's a great experience for Filipinos and visitors alike, it's always worth a trip here!

Time travel and food is not a common combination to have, but stepping inside La Cocina De Tita Moning is to be transported back to Manila's opulent past. The restaurant-cum-ancestral house offers patrons a dining experience like no other.  To start things off, you are given a tour of the mansion and told tidbits and stories pertaining to the Legarda family. The tour starts in the first floor and you gradually make your way up where you'll eventually be led to the dining area. Describing it as extravagant and exquisite is putting it mildly. There are rose petals strewn about the length of your table. There are literal bells you can pick up and ring to get the attention of the help. The whole experience is surreal.The food itself isn't bad. It's obviously inclined towards Spanish fare given the Legarda family's heritage. It's not the best though. Paying a visit to La Cocina De Tita Moning is something I'd recommend. Not for the food, but for the whole experience involved as a whole.

In true blue grandiose Filipino fashion, La Cocina De Tita Moning serves up some amazing traditional Filipino food.

Tristan R.","As a law student, finding a great coffee shop where I can hunker down and study in comfort is a must. Cafe-UK should be the poster child for the kind of place I'm talking about.Cafe-UK is one of those cafes that manages to establish it's own identity able to set itself apart from the generic or those that aspire to be a copycat of Starbucks.They have tea, coffee, juice, and a wide variety of American canned drinks that you won't find in your local grocery. There's a lot of food to choose from. They're a bit pricey, but the size and the taste will more than make up for it.Cafe UK has some of the best cakes I've ever had. Their cakes come in the form of a slice or a mini cake. I love the fact that they offer several kinds of cheesecake with the triple chocolate cheesecake being my favorite, I mean it's cheesecake and chocolate come on!Cafe UK is open 24 hours, and becomes a great places to study at around nine in the evening. Things are quiet at this hour up to around ten in the morning the following day, at which point it becomes a melting pot for the different students from the different schools that populate Mendiola.Wi-fi is free, which is probably another reason why so many students love to congregate at this awesome cafe. The biggest quirk that this cafe has that I don't find anywhere else are the free to use iPads. Never have I walked into a cafe that has free to use iPads, These iPads are ingeniously built into the table, I often find students spending a lot of their time drinking their orders and playing the latest games on Cafe UK's tablet.Free WiFi, excellent food and drinks, wonderful prompt service, and the tablets allows Cafe UK to deliver a great experience. Go for a visit sometime and I promise you that it'll be time and money well spent.

I've been looking for a place to have coffee and read my books peacefully, good thing i found this place. They have free internet and delicious snacks. Great place to study. It's like a coffee shop without the noisy people beautiful everyones studying too","Frequently Asked Question:
