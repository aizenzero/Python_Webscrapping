The food was absolutely delicious. I can recommend the kakanin mouth watering and  it's delightful.. There's a delicious smell in here,  obviously full of flavor.. i love filipino foods..

What we loved: Food Taste with TwistManam is one of my go to food places for Filipino food with a twist. Their sisig, kare kare and crispy pancit are some that we enjoyed. The food is so good that we forgot to take photos of what we ate. Photos attached belong to Manam and intent is to visually represent the meals we enjoyed. What is just okay: AmbianceIf you're looking for a place to casually meet with friends and family, this is an okay restaurant. However, since the tables are quite near with each other, you would have to exert a little effort to share your stories/kwentos with your friends or family while dining since the place is usually packed during lunch and dinner. What can be improved: ServiceDownside is their Podium branch does not accept reservations. Although their Greenbelt and BGC one does tho. Not sure if it is a consistency of reservation guidelines of Manam or what. It would be nice if they could have an online reservation especially for special days when we want a sure table reserved already.

I recently visited this buzzing restaurant and was blown away by the amazing Filipino cuisine! Every dish we ordered was delicious, including the chicken wings patis, crispy sisig, sinigang na watermelon, crispy pansit palabok, and laing. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone craving authentic Filipino food.In addition to the amazing food, we also enjoyed some refreshing cocktails and the cereal milk ice cream dessert which was out of this world. We liked it so much that we came back twice in one week!Be prepared for a wait upon arrival as the restaurant can get quite busy, but you can order ahead of time while waiting. And make sure to save room for the ube sago, mango sago, and biko panda sago - they're a must-try!Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for its delicious food, great drinks, and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back for more!

The food here is great! You can choose classic traditional or classic dishes with a twist (fusion) style. The service is great with friendly attentive staff! The place is festive and bright, and can accommodate large groups.  All the food was great! The Sizzling Crispy Sinagang was outstanding! It was a fusion style with crispy pork and a creamy sinigang soup.

The food was okay, in general, but the bulalo meat needed more time to cook, the beef that was served to us was semi-hard. The seats are not very comfortable, and the servers were not very attentive - we had to attempt five times to call their attention just to pay the bill! It's too bad, I was looking forward to having really good Filipino food & service.Here's what we ordered:Chicharon bulaklak - excellentGising-gising - excellentLaing - excellentFresh lumpia - the sauce is terrible, this needs to be changed ASAP! it is too bad, everything else on this lumpia was goodSizzling bulalo - I was actually looking forward to this one, I got disappointed because the beef was hardI would've given four stars, but the servers were not attentive at all despite my trying to be friendly with them. I hope this improves, I know that the Philippines is known for it's customer service & great hospitality.Wishing all the best!

Food is no doubt really good. It satisfies my cravings for Filipino food. It would also be nice if they have sago't gulaman in their menu. That's the only one lacking.

FOOD & DRINKS ARE SO GOOD! My family and I came back twice in one week. The restaurant gets really busy and there may be a wait upon arrival. When you are waiting, you can order ahead of time. The ube sago, mango sago and biko panda sago are a must-order! I am definitely coming back for more!

The restaurant (inside and outside) was buzzy on a Tuesday night which felt like it was a Friday. My cousin and his wife treated me to a sumptuous dinner and every dish they ordered was delicious! We had chicken wings patis, crispy sisig, sinigang na watermelon, crispy pansit palabok, and laing. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who craves for real Filipino cuisine!

One of the cravings upon arriving in the Philippines was to taste Filipino cuisines, and yes, we came to the right place; Manam has an incredible Filipino menu and some with a twist. Their location in Sm Baguio is spacious with inside and outside seating, Filipino paintings ambiance as well as friendly staff.Their menu is kinda overwhelming as it mostly comes with a twist and so far we did loved most of the dishes we ordered. We had;Crispy Black Ink Palabok (medium) - I was fascinated when it arrived; the twist was the palabok was fried, and the sauce was poured in it, though it was a lot for us; as soon as the sauce was poured and mixed, it did subside; this was deliciously crunchy, not so oily yet tasty..Sizzling Bangus Belly sisig (medium)- tasty, and a significant amount of servingGarlic rice- just the perfect taste of garlic not so salty and oilyMango+Pomelo+Sago- Large quantity as theirs no medium size my sister did not like it much, said the mango was not that sweet.Ube +Sago- it was delicious I did liked itUbe Bibingka- just the right taste and delicious Puto Bumbong with Muscovado Butter- my favourite that I ordered again the second time we visited. The perfect texture of the sticky rice, the right amount of muscovado and butter and the addition of cheese made it so delicious.Overall, we did love Manam; the price is reasonable but maybe a little pricy for those on budget; they have different dishes to choose from pang umagahan (breakfast), pang tabghalian (lunch), pang hapunan (dinner), merienda, beverages and desserts.It is highly recommended for those looking for an authentic Filipino dish. Check them out. They have branches all over the Philippines","Frequently Asked Question:

?","My family and I enjoyed spending time.. Yes, we're fine dining, we want everybody to enjoy the food,The food was absolutely delicious. I can recommend the chicken and the flavorful rice it's delicious. There's a delicious smell in here. That was a delicious dinner, thank you.

Ambiance 5/5Service 5/5Quick to plate 5/5Food taste 2/5The pomelo salad was nice and unique. The pad Thai was alrightThe crispy lapu lapu lacked flavorThe tom yum goong was light and natural but lacked sour and tasteThe drinks were niceFor the price I expected much better taste. Unfortunately mango tree is better and that's not even the best here in manila

One of my favorite places for Thai Cuisine in the city, I've tried other restaurants in the city, but this restaurant is still the prime.My favorites are Lamb Curry, Pad Thai, Pomelo Salad, and Mango Sticky Rice. People's Palace is one of my go-to's.

Can I give 10 stars!!! The best Thai food!!!! The pomelo salad is everything! The sweetness and the crunch from the peanuts. And the shrimp rolls... oh man, if only we had that kind of Thai food in the Bay Area. Thank you for a several magnificent lunches! The service is always on point in the Philippines and the ambiance is crisp, clean and minimalist!

Ate here with friends who visit Manila quite often. The food was unmistakably THE BEST Thai food outside Thailand. Good for large groups. I had the whole snapper and the salad. Friends had pad Thai . Everything is great!

Order the crispy catfish salad, koi sao chicken curry and larb gai. Aside from soms restaurant, it's the best thai restaurant for me in the ph.

Peoples Palace is just about the hottest Thai Restaurant in Manila right now and the buzz has been following me since back in New Jersey....I can see why.Reservations are a must and even then you're in a holding pattern for that time. Walk ins are asked for their phone number and then expect another 1 to 2 hour wait if at all.The dining room is minimally furnished,all hard woods and sharp white plastic edges,plain walls,2 modern motifs over the bar and some benign art scattered about that's it. This room is all business.... eat.pay,and get the hell out ..we have diners waiting.Menu is extensive and covers everything from the ever faithful pad Thai to duck curry but we decided to go with the favorites.First up. The pomelo salad, sanctioned pomelo,shrimp,cilantro,onions,Thai basil in a tart lime/kaffir/fish sauce and sugar dressing. Sweet,sour,spicy and shrimpy all at the same time. Very good appetizer to start the meal.The Tom yum was so complex and savory with a spicy bite that gently creeps up on you ....then before you are completely aware you go ""damn that's pretty hot!"" The shrimp as well as the fermented fish belly lends its distinctive taste and I had a ball sucking on the fat shrimp heads.The sautéed water spinach was a bit too salty but all was forgiven when both the duck and chicken curries hit the table. Duck curry was in a red curry sauce that was hot and sour from the tamarind paste, salty from the top shelf fish sauce and spicy from the Thai chili's. Chicken in yellow curry with sweet potatoes was creamy from the coconut milk based sauce with the potatoes lending that satisfying sweet finish. Both of these dishes required several trips from the waiter dispensing aromatic steamed rice from a large metal bowl.The breaded and fried Lapu lapu was next and the flaky meat was clean and  fresh Rare sliced beef with a lemongrass fish sauce was so pungent with all the aromatics that we barely touched it but the fried pork belly salad? Was a thing of beauty.... succulent ,crispy and sweet. I absolutely love Filipino pork.This was a huge meal ( there were 10 of us) service never wavered, food came out quickly but well spaced,prices were high by Manila standards but reasonable by US standard so a good meal....... but.In my mind People's Palace strikes me as having too much of a production line "" get them in and get them out"" ethic and I believe the food reflects that. Seasoning were at times overdone,presentation messy  and some taste become "" muddy"" for the lack of a better word.Go, eat, enjoy... People's Palace may well be the hottest Thai restaurant in Manila but I doubt the best. The quest continues.

Honestly, I am perplexed with the high rating.  I've definitely had much better Thai food in Canada, which is surprising, considering Philippines is closer to Thailand. Anyway, I did not find the flavours to be anything special, nothing like the flavours synchronizing with each other, which Thai food is known for.  Nothing about the taste of this meal is spectacular.After saying all that above, the cost is actually quite high for a Thai place, even higher than the other restaurants around the Greenbelt area which I tried.  Honestly.  The chicken wrapped in leaves was rock hard. I did not even taste the fish in the lapu lapu dish... was it frozen? The pad thai was crap.  It was just sweet. wtf.  The bagoong fried rice was way too salty, it just tastes like bagoong.   I've had better tom yum from a soup base I bought at an asian supermarket. The sticky mango rice was probably the best thing I tasted, oh and the milk tea, it was ok, but I've had better for sure.This place is located inside a mall.  The venue looks all right.  We did not have to wait to get in, although it was busy there for lunch.

People's Palace has been around for over a decade and is still constantly packed with people, holding its place as one of Manila's staples. Top dishes have to be the Chicken Pandan, Pomelo Salad, Green Curry, Prawn Cakes, Pad Thai, Prawn Spring Rolls and Chicken with Cashew. The white rice is unlimited and while the fried rice options are great, I would recommend white rice to enjoy the flavors of the individual dishes.The restaurant is great for entertaining guests, catching up with friends and for small and large parties but be sure to make reservations in advanced. There is also outdoor seating available, however if you are sensitive to the Manila heat - best to reserve to guarantee a table inside.

Food: 3.5/5.0Service: 3.5/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.5/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0Pretty good Thai spot.  Very busy, very posh.","Frequently Asked Question:

Zack M.","Absolutely love this place! Definitely one of my favorite spots. During my trip to the Philippines we visited this place pretty often! I got the Filipino breakfast plate quite a few times and the matcha latte pretty much every visit. The pastries we tried were so delicious. We tried a few different ones every visit to share and they were yummy. The service was amazing! The servers were so incredibly nice and I always had a wonderful experience. Can't wait to come back here during my next visit to the motherland! Also, they accept credit cards here, which is a plus. I noticed that during my visit to the Philippines, a lot of places were cash or GCash only, and as someone who does not have a GCash account, I was glad they accepted card here!

I been coming here for 4 years. Still everything is a 1% best to most cafes i been to. Hats off to MY server  andy he is the best and thank you wild-flour for making my morning

This is a nice place love the Chocolate Carmel salted cake very rich texture and the size of slice ooh good for two. The problem I see in this restaurant as well as what I've witnessed anywhere else is that the Place is to over staffed,  and disorganized lot of confusion you have more than one waitress working 1 table when you pay the check the next thing you know someone else is asking you to pay.. You have everyone looking like they don't know what to do..just stand around. My advice cutt the one's who not putting in their weight and keep the one's who look like they really want to be there to learn and serve. And to give the best experience possible. You only need 1 waitress to serve 2 to 4 tables and send the left over waitresses home or start another shift

The Rada St location in Legaspi Village is our go to for coffee and breakfast. The staff is friendly and welcoming and the food selection and quality never disappoints.

I love the serving in BGC branch, nice location and atmosphere.can do meetings while enjoying their food

Pastries, breads, cookies, cronuts and the jarred polvorons are the bomb. Love having breakfast here. Specifically at their Rockwell branch. Friendly staff. Good food and drinks. Love the kimchi pork fried rice. Downside is you have to oark at the mall.

Really yummy breakfast I had the adobo rice and egg bowl. Would recommend:) only downside is they didn't have creamer or half & half for coffees so don't order coffee that you like to have with creamer.

As one of the partners at the helm is a 3-star Michelin chef, one should be curious about Wildflour Cafe + Bakery and its creations. The team is also responsible for operating some restaurants in and around LA (e.g. Republique and Grand Central Market shops). That being said, their actual printed menu does look mostly Americanized which might not be what someone wants when they visit a new city. However, if you peruse their baked section, you might find something of interest... in the form of ube! I picked through for an *Ube Keso Pandesal* (php 75) and an *Ube Pound Cake* (php 115). I was enamored with the ube keso pandesal as it was light, scrumptious, and filled with some funky, salted cheese. The sponge cake was moist with a faint ube flavor. Their entire selection was so enticing to be honest. I know Filipinos are all about displaying their wares, but I somewhat wished they were behind a splash guard or locked away in a display case. In the end, I never handled any of the bread anyways as a worker came around to pack away my items. Nonetheless, if you can get passed the potential germy aspect, yummy bread you will have the pleasure of enjoying!

I love this place. Coffee concoctions are good, the espresso tends to be sour by itself. Great breads and pastries, food is good, prices are on the high side. A slice of egg pie runs you up in the 275 range. The dinner menu is pricey. Great idea on the different menus for specific times.

This café has nice atmosphere and good food. The waiters are nice too. A little pricey though.

Can't go wrong with any location of this place. Sweet stock of all kinds of delights from freshly made pies, cookies and brownies to innovative gluten free desserts and tasty drinks. This place is outperforming and gives the big boys Starbucks and Coffee Bean a lesson or two on how to do things better. Service is great and ambiance gives off a unique homy vibe. Depending on the location there is outdoor and indoor seating. Too bad there aren't more locations around the city.","Frequently Asked Question:

Terrin S.","I'm told that Crying Tiger was from the same folks who brought us El Chupacabra on Polaris St., so I had an idea of what to find when I can down here: a chill, easy going hang out place with good food and cheap beer.It's a bit hard to find since its hidden on a side street behind Fersal Hotel , which is just in front of A-Venue mall. Just keep walking and you'll be greeted by the smokey grill, colorful lights and Makati's foodie crowd. As soon as I stepped inside, I already knew I was going to like this place. It's like El Chupa only cleaner, less dingy and has more of a beach bum kind of feel. (I think it's the wooden floorboards and colorful lights.) The only thing I didn't like, maybe was the fact that they kept on asking if I had ordered yet, or if there was anyone with me. (Which I get, since they're busy and I'm all alone at a table, but I had already explained that I was waiting for more people, which they seemed to forget.) On to the food: if you don't like anything spicy or flavorful, this place is not for you. Seriously. Their chicken is AMAZING. I love their spicy kangkong (doused with oil though), which pairs well with their fried rice.  They've also got a large selection of cocktails and wine, apart from the normal beers. (I got lychee cocktail! Pretty yum.)Definitely coming back and making this a regular hang out! It's cleaner, newer, and is better ventilated than El Chupa.

Location & DirectionsThe street faces the A Venue entrance with Domino's Pizza and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. (on foot) From ""A Venue"", cross Makati Ave, walk along Guanzon, and you'll see the restaurant on your left.RestaurantI expected it to be warm since it's hole-in-the-wall but it's kinda breezy during the evening, making our stay relaxing. The dine-in space is limited with a few seats outside but they have a bar, high chairs and all.Morning Glory with GarlicThis one is typical veggies. It's okay to have for mixing things up but I won't really look for it.Thai Basil ChickenWe liked it enough to get an extra order. We shared but each order is already a meal for one person.Thai Stir Fried Glass NoodlesThis is their Pad Thai. It's good but not the best I've had just yet.ServiceIt was quick up to taking care of the bill.

Such a welcomed find when looking for a place to grab some late dinner and a drink walkable from my hotel. I asked for some recommendations for a drink and food that had spice. Had a lemongrass, lime and Thai basil mojito. Tasty and actually paired well with the food. I got a rice dish called Gabi Pad Ka Prao (Thai basil chicken); has great flavor although a bit more salty than necessary. I also had the Pad See Ew (Stir fried wide noodles with chicken); this was spiced perfectly, probably one the absolute best Thai dishes I've had.

Crying Tiger Street Kitchen is one of Poblacion's ever favorite hole-in-the-wall Southeast Asian cuisine restaurants that will take you back to the street market food stalls of Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. A bit hidden on P. Guanzon, the street directly facing the frontside of A.Venue Mall, this restaurant is widely known among the neighborhood, but could be easily located on an online map.Dining was an easy breezy as the dishes are described in the updated menu spread with photos of their best-selling items. We had their famous Mee Goreng, Beef Rendang, and Thai Iced Tea.Our food was served in less than 15 minutes, considered fast for table-service restaurants. Calling the attention of the service crew, asking for recommendations, and ordering were all easy. Most service crews were welcoming, though we encountered one who just grabbed the menu spread and the tissue rack off our table when we were still dining. We didn't mind, but it could have been much more courteous if she spoke with us and asked for permission, as we were still eating. Also, the music could have been much softer to preserve the relaxing vibe, because it was hard to hear my companions when we were chatting, to the point that we had to shout at each other.Their Mee Goreng was full of ingredients and a plate could serve up to two to three people--but less in seafood. I mean, what's a ""spicy seafood noodles"" without much spice and just a few pieces of seafood? It was flavorful and a bit on the sweet-spicy side, may be catering to Filipino tongues that are used to the sweet palette.Beef Rendang, their take on Malaysia's spicy beef curry, was an instant favorite. The meat in the dish generously spicy and soft that it tasted like it was braised slowly and carefully. With rice, the dish can only serve and would leave you wishing you'd have more.The Thai Iced Tea was the spice quencher, if it suddenly feels hot when eating both the Mee Goreng and the Beef Rendang.Crying Tiger is definitely a must-visit in the area if you crave for Southeast Asian dishes, but make sure to get a table before groups go in around dinnertime as it gets full with avid patrons.

I've written 2 Yelp reviews before this one, both 5 star (jm a positive guy!), but my experience here was so bad, and the attitude of the staff was so ""could not give a f*@k,"" I cannot let it pass. Although it seemed sort of busy on a Tuesday night, I was seated fairly quickly, but then ignored for over 10 minutes before I flagged someone down to serve me.  I ordered a single pork skewer as a starter, the pad see ew as my main, and a beer.  I kid you not, the pad see ew was slapped on my table less than 90 seconds later ... uh that's way too fast for me to believe it was not just reheated slop, which is exactly what it was.  There were almost no noodles, and the stringy pieces of chicken were swimming in a soupy mixture of ... whatever.  While the flavor was not bad, it was texturally disgusting. I get it, you're busy and missed the mark.  I expressed my disappointment at the food, and explained you cannot serve your guests that fast, and not make them suspicious ... I've worked in many restaurants, so I always try to give benefit of doubt.  I asked what could be done about it, and said I didn't think I should have to pay for such a poor attempt; my server was extremely confused and just took off.  I assumed they just forgot about my pork skewer starter, but it finally did arrive a good 10 minutes after my main.  It was good enough. I was then ignored for over 15 minutes!  That is not exaggeration, I timed it.  The place is not big, my server (and many others) walked by several times ... it seemed like they understood they screwed up, but just did not want to deal with it.  Finally, I had to actually grab my server to tell him I would pay for my beer and skewer only; I left the money on the table and just walked out. I'm sure it's normally not that bad ... probably even good, but there are so many amazing options around here, I'm scratching Chupacabra off my list too.

The Mabantas of Makati are unstoppable!!! The folks behind El Chupacabra, Senor Pollo and Mexicali have done it again with a spanking new concept that is bound to be yet another hit among the young crowd. Crying Tiger is their stellar homage to Southeast Asian food, and it is something that I would love to come back to over and over again. I love my Southeast Asian food. Having spent some time in Indonesia, I have grown to love familiar flavors that really remind me of lovely combinations of spices, fresh ingredients and simple preparations. When I heard that they have mee goreng, albeit the Malaysian kind, I got super excited. Their fried seafood noodles have that awesome balance of spiciness, sweetness and sourness. Order a serving of fried egg with it. I also tried the chicken curry, which was superb.The food is yummy, the beer is cold, the prices are affordable for Makati standards, and the service is great even if they are still on soft open.

Good food, tried the Char Siu Pork Plate. Good ambiance. To nit-pick, the utensils used seems very cheep. It doesn't compliment the aesthetic of the place. Anyways, the most important factor os the tase of the food, which is otherwise goos.

My biggest issue with buying Asian Street food in Manila is how expensive it gets once you prepare it here. I mean, come on, why is Satay retailing for P100/stick? It's chicken on a stick with peanut sauce! And don't get me started with Pho, Roti, and Bahn Mi!So imagine my delight when I saw a new ""hole-in-the-wall"" type Thai place open up in Poblacion, Makati. The name alone (Crying Tiger) gave me an inkling that this place was irreverent and had a sense of humor. I was not mistaken. The joint itself was not going to wow you with their brilliant interiors, and I think that was the point. While there are splashes of inspiration here and there, the place looks like an artsy carinderia. Even the food is not presented all artsy and stuff, and that's the beauty of it! Because once you bite into their Fried Chicken or their Thai Barbeque (Marinated with Coconut milk), you will swoon. YOU WILL SWOON. And it's incredibly cheap too!Okay, I got so hungry typing this review that I'm going back there right now.

Ok truth be told, I'm really not big on Thai food. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine at a Thai restaurant because it's just not my preference...for some odd reason (same goes with Korean cuisine). Anyway! I ended up at Crying Tiger for a boss' despedida for drinks and heavy midnight munchies...or meal. We left the ordering to our boss and I'm surprised to even say that I was about to hit a food comatose. The food was so, so simple yet packed with flavour. I never really appreciated Thai flavours until today. Wew!The place was pretty packed for a late Thursday night, but we were luckily able to seat ourselves. Service was pretty fast considering that 1) we ordered A LOT and 2) it was about 20 minutes before last call. I really can't believe I'm saying this, but the food was so good that I'm most likely going to drag my friends there one of these days. The ambiance was so so. The bathroom look a lot better than the main floor itself. Parking wasn't really a problem. The only downside to it was that the beer wasn't that cold..and that's kind of a big deal for me because the first thing I usually ask for in a restaurant is their beer availability.Overall experience is def a 4.5/5 and I'm definitely coming back!

We order the spring rolls, Malaysian chicken curry, and Thai basil chicken. The spring rolls were good and fun with a surprise roll having a pepper. (We were properly warned by our server). The Malaysian curry chicken and basil chicken were delicious. The server recommended the basil chicken and we were not disappointed!","Frequently Asked Question:

I'll definitely be back!""    I had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant to others.

One of the best ramen I've ever had! Glad my cousins took me here. We came toward the end of the night but it was still quite packed! Just shows how good the food is. We were able to ""pre order"" while waiting so as soon as we sat down, the ramen shortly followed. I ordered the tantanmen and wow! It was so creamy, delicious and bursting with flavor. We also ordered the shoyo and miso and all were extremely flavorful and rich. I loved it. Ambiance reminded me of Japan as we all sat side by side in a wrap around bar. Next time I'm in Makati, I am definitely stopping by!

Must Visit! Ordered: Miso Ramen & Gyzoa. Hands down one of the best ramen spots I visited in Makati.Highly recommend going early and hungry seating is limited, and the portion is generous. After reading all the reviews I made sure to be there within 15 minutes of opening.Upon arrival, you are required to show your vaccination card - hard copy or digital. You'll then be sent to the cashier to place your order. The best part is you can watch from the boat-shaped kitchen counter your meal being prepared. The menu is straightforward. The most popular and what I had was the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen.  Other options:* Tsukemen cold noodles are separate from the broth. * Maze Soba - dry noodles served with a thick sauce.* Hiyashi Ramen, commonly loaded with vegetables and meat All best paired with their delicious Gyoza.  This miso soup was light on the palate but bold in flavor. Noodles were a perfect balance of firm and chewy. Topped, with tender cuts of smoked chatsu slices. You are left with such a lingering sense of satisfaction once consumed. You'll be planning your next visit right after. Note: Customers can choose their spice level.You can find better-priced ramen around the city but this is worth every penny. Overall, great taste, presentation, and service is quick. Mi

Worth the wait! There was a long line and their process from taking orders, paying and receiving orders were efficient!! Ramen was superb! Sarap!! Oishi!

Mendokoro Ramenba in Makati is a must-visit spot for ramen lovers. This authentic Japanese restaurant serves up some of the best ramen in the city. Their menu is small but carefully crafted, focusing on quality over quantity. The rich and flavorful broth, tender pork slices, and perfectly cooked noodles are all standout elements of their dishes. The ambiance is cozy and intimate, with a traditional Japanese feel. Although there can be long queues, the wait is worth it for the satisfying and delicious meal.

Delicious food! Other 5 star reviews don't steal you wrong- definitely go to heat here!

One of the best ramen bars in the ph. Mahaba ang line and medyo matagal ang waiting time. But I believe, gugutumin ka niya para lalo mo ma appreciate anb soup. My personal favorite is tantanmen of course

Got the Buta Kwkuni Ramen, delicious. Perfect blend of rich spicy broth and sweetness from the smoked pork. Definitely filling with its thick noodles

Best. ramen. in. Manila.That is definitely a heavy-handed claim given how popular the savory noodle dish is out here, but Mendokoro Ramenba holds its own amongst the competition.It's easy to make comparisons to the competition--Nagi, Ippudo, Santouka, and even options a price bracket down like Kuroda, but the presentation, taste, and consistency put Mendokoro one step above the rest.If you come here during normal lunch or dinner hours, prepare to wait. The dining room itself is centered around their show kitchen and there are probably only about 20-odd seats available. The dining room itself is pretty sleekly appointed with lots of warm Instagram-friendly lighting and nice wood textures. You pay ahead of time and then patiently wait for your turn. As with most other ramen places in this price segment, there is absolutely no take-out allowed, probably so cunning fans can't reverse-engineer their broth. Service here is amazing. The waitstaff and cooks are all super courteous and high-energy, seemingly unphased by the never-ending throngs of hungry fans. My water never dipped below half-full for the entirety of my meal, a considerable achievement considering how busy it is here.Now for the food. I recommend getting the gyoza to accompany the ramen. It's one of the best ones I've had outside of Japan!! It's pillowy-soft on the inside yet still with that perfect crisp on the outside. The flavors are delicate--not too salty, not too scallion-y. The umami is amazing.The ramen is amaaaaazing!! Anything on the menu is sure to please but my favorites boil down to the shio ramen and the tantanmen. While I feel as though the tantanmen could benefit from more meat, the broth and noodles are excellently done. The fact that the food is prepared in front of you is also a huge benefit.I do leave you with one warning though--this is not a ramen place to lounge around and make tambay with your barkada. You do feel a sense of urgency to get your ramen, enjoy it, and go since tons of people are waiting and the service is so speedy. Also, if you come with a large group of people, there's a real chance you won't be seated together. But for how good their ramen is, that's a small price to pay.

I am a huge fan of Ramen even though I don't eat it often. The place is small and cozy. You're sitting on stools next to people. They cook the food pretty fast which is great! The broth is kinda creamy and very flavorful. Ramen comes with veggies, a slice of meat (pork) and an egg. The bowl it comes in is pretty big. If one slice of meat isn't enough you can order a side of pork slices. The pork was tender and juicy which I was very pleased with. But here is why I can only give the place 3 stars. The place opens around 10:30. I got there at like 11. Because it's popular and seating is very limited, I had to wait about an hour. The place is small too so most of the waiting took place outside in the heat (not great). The food was good but I don't think anything is really worth an hour wait. The bowl seemed to be mostly broth. So if you feel full it's probably from the broth.","Frequently Asked Question:

The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. I would definitely come back!the food was delicious and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  i was so admire and so happy, the ambiance was so great.

The place is really cute and trendy. It has a very nice home. Feel to it. I thoroughly enjoy the bar area as it styled very nice. The restaurants lower level is very clean and modern. However, the tables are a bit close making it a little uncomfortable to get through. The upstairs is very intimate and quaint the back patio seems to be the most popular if you can get past the humidity.They have a decent wine selection, and the cocktails seem fun, but haven't been my personal favorite. The food also has quite a bit of variety, making it hard to choose but there's pretty much some thing for everyone. I was just not a fan that everything came with either rice or pasta or potatoes. I try to eat low carb, so it was a little bit of a challenge. I ended up going with the hanger steak, but it was not , my favorite sometimes the food lacks a little bit of flavor but that's probably just personal taste. It's definitely a nice choice in comparison to the options in town and worth checking out.

Often, during my travels in the United States or overseas, I've been asked what is the best restaurant in the city that I am in? I think I have found one for Manila in the Philippines.  Blackbird if not the best, is amongst the best restaurants in Manila.Blackbird is an Asian fusion and modern European restaurant. Its menu is diverse with and enticing list of dishes. Problem here is which ones do you choose? We visited for lunch and started with the beet salad, then the quail scotch eggs, followed by the lamb kofta balls. The main dish was Kerala fish curry.  How was the food? The beet salad had nice color, and a very fresh taste. The scotch eggs were made with shrimp, something unique, and arrived at the table with an enticing presentation on betel leaves, with coconut chili sambal. They were delicious. The lamb kofta was moist superb flavor, a good charred taste and appearance, and melted in your mouth. The Kerala fish curry was made with a meaty white fish, in a silky yellow coconut curry.  This dish came with papadum, green chutney, mango chutney, and basmati rice.  Another popular hit on their menu.So is the food alone enough to make a restaurant five stars?  I would say no.  During review, we have to count the ambience, the service, the table settings, and the background music.  In all these departments blackbird deserves five stars. They provided fresh plates and cutlery for every dish that arrived at our table, a rare table service, but a gesture that elevates the dining encounter to another level.  The music was an eclectic mix of jazz and European.  The whole experience at Blackbird was exhilarating and a culinary treat to the taste buds and all the human gastronomic senses.

We had a great time dining here. Reservations was smooth and organized, the host was amazing. Serving staff was friendly, attentive and gave tips about the food. The restaurant is beautiful in a minimalist way. Definitely a nice go to for special occasions or definitely for that nice, fancy date night :) will definitely visit again. Good portions are great for sharing. Drinks are flavorful- not strong. If bartender can find the middle point it'll be allPerfect!

Great and quick service. Love the ambiance. Food portions and quality very good . Must make reservations!

Excellent dinner , three 3 generations all satisfied. Great service, chilled wine didn't stop coming, loved all the appetizers and every entree was beautifully presented.

Gorgeous restaurant in a restored building in the heart of Makati CBD. I've always seen this place on social media and have been curious as to why it is so popular. As you enter, you'll see the bar on your right and a seating area on the left. The vibe is airy and sophisticated yet warm and inviting. Once you enter the dining area, you'll see their iconic table with a huge flower arrangement that showcases and complements the high ceilings and exposed beams. Love the natural light filtering through the restaurant when we had lunch at Blackbird. I've heard mixed reviews about their food and honestly, I agree that their food is gorgeous and photogenic but a bit overpriced and taste is so so. Dessert was mixed reviews too -- their sticky toffee pudding seems to be reheated in the microwave as it was a bit dry and lackluster. The baked alaska was wonderful though and I enjoyed that over the sticky toffee. Service was great and they were very personable.Overall, I'm just glad that I've finally tried Blackbird just so that I can tick it off my list.

Great atmosphere both inside and outside dining area. Such a good variety of offerings on their menu. Service is exactly what I am accustomed to, coming from Las Vegas, NV. It was so good that I went back a second time. The only hiccup was the service experience the second night. I think they forgot about us when we were seated outside. I did speak with an assistant manager to bring it to his attention, which he rectified. Will definitely go there again.

Place is beautiful! You can do either indoor or outdoor dining, just make sure you call ahead and reserve a spot because they get booked a lot during weekends. Ordered lots of food here and the best would probably be the tuna poké. You should try the mushroom cappuccino soup and the pumpkin soup; they're both cooked and warmed perfectly. As for the main, I ordered their special for the day which is the sirloin steak. It was just okay for me though, seasoned good but not perfect. Overall, I had a really good experience here.

Amazing food here. Make reservations beforehand. A great selection of food and the portions are just right. Great place for a date or family celebration. Plan ahead because it can be very traffic and difficult to get here.","Frequently Asked Question:

I am in Manila alone for business and wanted to try some local food.I started with the baked mussels with cheese and had the Bistek Ostrich with garlic rice for my main meal. The mussels were amazing! Never had them like that and they came with a spicy vinegar dipping sauce. A healthy portion of rice and an ok amount of Ostrich. I just had water to drink but there was a fun drink menu with some interesting options. I sat inside, but there is an outside seating area and a nice well stocked bar out there too. Only 4 stars because they never came back to fill up my empty water glass and it took a while to flag someone down for the bill despite it not being that busy. Good food, I'd go back, but be patience.

So this place has crab with a choice of sauces to include black pepper sauce.  They also have a seafood platter with crab, shrimp, and squid in sweet chili sauce.  Not a fan of the Chilli sauce so asked if they can prepare the seafood platter using an alternate sauce like perrer sauce.  This throughly confused the waitress who called a manager who then explained the seafood platter was already mixed with sauce even before it's ordered.  I am sure that is not the case. So asked if the chef could accommodate the simple request.  He could not.  Staff here obviously does not understand how to think outside the box.Ended up ordering shrimp sinigang, which lacked flavor and had small shrimps.  Ultimately, I would not recommend this place.

We ate at Manam two days in a row, and wanted to try other restaurants in Greenbelt. I saw Edna G's review of this place, so we decided to try this place. It was a warm and (a little too) humid afternoon for me, so we waited for a few minutes to get a table indoors. We ordered a bunch of dishes. Might have been one too many as there were only two of us! We ordered the Tinapa Eggrolls, Mango Salad, Crispy Pata, Grilled Bangus Belly on Banana Leaves and Garlic Rice. The eggrolls were interesting. I like Tinapa but I don't know if I like it in an eggroll. Better to stick with pork and shrimp, or vegetables for eggroll fillings. The Salad was great. It was a small portion but nice and bright flavors. The Bangus Belly was good and so was the garlic rice. The star was definitely the Crispy Pata! It was so good. Really crispy skin, tender meat and very garlicky! Loved it. Of course we didn't get to eat much of it since we had all that other food. The moral of this story is to just order the Crispy Pata and Garlic Rice if there's only 2 of you. We couldn't really take the leftovers with us as we were flying the next day to a different island.We had no room for dessert, so we didn't get to try any of their desserts. Next time. Food timing and service were both good. Even though it was 3 pm, it was still quite busy.  But then we ate there a few days before Christmas. Busy season for sure!!

Eats: Sinigang na Salmon Head, Inihaw sampler, crispchon, and liempo Takes: Of all the Filipino restaurants in the Philippines, Mesa was one of the most memorable ones for me mainly because of their lechon done 2 ways. One of the ways was in a wrap similar to a mini burrito. Inside this green pandan wrap is the lechon (pork), cilantro, and jimica paired with your choice of dipping sauce. The second way is your traditional chopped lechon. I literally would go here just to have their Crispchon served in a wrap. Service: Attentive. If you need anything, someone is always there within the vicinity.Wait Time: If possible, go during ""off hours"" or make a reservation beforehand to minimize your wait. If you go during peak hours, your wait time can be at least 45 mins/over an hour. Note: Even with a reservation, expect to still wait. During my most recent visit, we even opted to eat outside; otherwise, our wait time would've been an additional 30 mins for indoor seating.Mesa is popping for a reason! They have locations throughout the Philippines. Parking: shared parking garageBottom line: Go here for your Filipino fusion fix!Highly recommended.

I read on a foodie blog that Mesa Filipino Moderne was a place to try in Manila. It was highly recommended, so naturally it was the first restaurant that my mom and I ate on our trip to the Philippines. Mesa was located at one of the wings in Greenbelt 5. The entrance to the restaurant was outside, so Mesa wasn't accessible inside the mall. I definitely liked the decor and interior design. It stayed true to the Filipino ""kultura"" with a modern twist. Similarly, the food was Filipino fusion as favorite dishes were reimagined.My mom and I ordered the pomelo salad, sisig in a pouch, and Mesa braised beef to share between the two of us. I liked everything except the sisig in the pouch, which grosses me out even more now that I'm writing about it. My mom hated the pomelo salad, but I thought it was quite good. Admittedly the salad threw me off at first. I thought it was going to have lettuce or some type of leafy green... salad in the traditional sense. But nope, it was straight up pomelo chunks. The pomelo was too sour for my mom, but I thought that the ground coconuts and whatever other seasonings Mesa used in the salad actually cut the sour/bitterness of the pomelo.The Mesa braised beef was excellent! The beef was super tender and extremely flavorful from the sauce it simmered in. I could definitely taste strong coconut flavor, and I believe there was a slight hint of shrimp paste sauce. The braised beef paired very well with garlic rice. The sisig in a pouch was a sisig fried dumpling. I  noticed that some of the chopped sisig pieces had cartilage still stuck to the meat. Secondly, I caught a piece of sisig in my mouth that was pork skin still with hair. I was so repulsed by the bristly feeling of the pork skin hair against my tongue. I've decided that I won't eat pork anymore after today thanks to this experience. Lastly, customer service was so bad! There were like 10 employees bussing tables on the floor yet none of them stopped to help us or see how we were doing. We had to go out of our way to flag someone for assistance.

If I could give a zero star I would!! We ordered sisig, crispy pata, chicken with garlic and Laing.  Everything is either burned or over cooked except for the Laing.  The food is so horrible!! Don't ever go to this place.

Food:4 Service:4Solid restaurant that serves tasty food. I only came here once and got the mango salad, sisig, the braised beef, and the bbq meats. Seriously, the only food here I highly recommend is the braised beef. Super tender and full of flavor. The bbq platter was nice and simple. It wasn't overcooked and was just right. The other dishes were aiites. I'd definitely like to come back to try other dishes in future.

We went here for a quick lunch with my aunt but ended up spending 3 hours here. They had an issue with the AC but had plenty of coolers to help. The food is mostly fusion or a different spin on Filipino food. They had excellent choices and most of them are well done.Service was good.  They are attentive and we did not feel hurried during our meal. Mesa gets a high recommendation.

My relatives took us while my husband and I were on a business trip. The ended up reserving one of the large party rooms in the back for almost 20 of us. We didn't know what to expect but had heard they had really good Filipino food at this restaurant. Our private room was very spacious and luckily right next to the restrooms! My cousins ordered for our party and food just started coming out. I didn't know what the names of the entrees are but we got seafood, BBQ platter, lechon, chicken, duck 2 ways with different sauces, and fried leche flan (looked like mini lumpa).We ordered the bottle Filipino beers (Red Horse) which is a bit more stronger and hoppier than the San Mig or San Mig lite. My husband and I tried anything and everything. We had so much food!!! We also had leftover food to take home. The service as always in PI is awesome and very respectful. I don't know if they take reservations but I do recommend it since there is a lot of people who dine here. There are indoor and outdoor tables available and located in a busy mall.

If in the Greenbelt area, you have to try Mesa. It's in Greenbelt where all the other restaurants are outside the Greenbelt mall. This place is always crowded and I understand why. They are open late during the weekdays and weekends. They offer indoor and outdoor seatings, also made for large groups. They do offer filtered water service in slanted glasses. We ordered: Buko shake - a must and was only place that had it this as a shake. All other places never have it or run out. We asked if we could have this to-go and they said they had no container for it...Boo!Lychee shake - a mustPalabok - thin noodles - very good portion and very goodBoneless crispy pata - lots of fried garlic ...a must buy it was not boneless?Fried tilapia -cut up in small pieces and deep fried, comes with four sauces - a mustLiang two ways - very good portion and very goodBangus with black bean chili sauce - very good but not spicyBBQ pork sticks - was good but way too small. Picture looked bigger.Beware as it gets warm and humid in Manila so if sitting outdoors and at night, mosquitos will be there looking for those foreigner legs...hahaha. Customer service was awesome and always checked if we needed anything except at the end but I will be back...","Frequently Asked Question:

Their version was crispy outside but tasty and juicy inside. Service was tops, accommodating, friendly and fast.  The ambiance was pretty simple. No frills but clean and comfortable. Price over size plating was a average.  My 9 year old son even enjoyed their shawarma hummus.  Ohhh the baklava... delicious! Will definitely be back here just before we go back to Saipan.

This was my first stop on my trip! It was one of the only spots open late night! Thank goodness because it is delicious. It's also much healthier than the other late night choices. The hummus here is delicious! I also like that you can order half or full sizes of the falafel. The half size is fulfilling already. If you eat just those two things, you should be quite satisfied. My family comes to this place quite often! I can see why!

A good falafel is hard to find anywhere, but I was amazed to find a superb one in the Philippines. Located in Makati, it is a 24/7 late night establishment perfect for the munchies after a night drinking or just one good food. The falafels here are legit coming in half (3 falafel) or full (5) size order with veggies and pita bread. The white sauce and red sauce are perfect compliments to the falafels. The hummus is a must with the falafel. Definitely worth the extra charge.Service is quick and prompt always. It is on the pricier size, but the quality is worth it. Definitely coming back here for my falafel fix in the future.

Open 24/7, located inside A Venue Mall. Not exactly a place that stands out much since this mall isn't really popular. 190 pesos for their burger special, which was really good. Comes with fries. The burger doesn't have any sauce but the meat quality is really good and seasoned well. They give you sauce on the side that you can add onto your burgers. The burger was delicious. You can taste it with and without the sauce for comparison. They have a full bar as well.

Beni's Falafel had been a popular falafel place that my friends would tell me its the best. We happen to passby here just before going to Batangas on a wee hours of the day. I was surprised to findout it is open for 24hours.So, we ordered their usual feast. The Beni's Falafel Sandwich with addtional Hummus. The pita pocket was filled with 5 balls of falafel with shredded cabbage, tomato, and a spread of hummus underneath. The falafel has a nice, crispy crust with a soft, moist center. I love the crunch and the spiced flavor of it. It reminded me of a vegan burger because of how it was eaten and the filling. We regularly put their white sauce (not the sweet, garlic sauce). The white sauce has a nutty bitterness due to tahini that give it another kick of flavor. The hummus was nice and smooth. It was really good! Beni's Falafel is now top of my list for Middle Eastern cuisine.#TheFoodCrawlers #OngsFoodprints #TheLostDiego

I consider myself a Beni's loyalist since I first tasted his famous Falafel sandwich. Although I am an unapologetic carnivore, I always leave Beni's satisfied without craving for any type of meat whatsoever. I ordered the Shakshuka in July last visit. I was almost disappointed when the Shakshuka that was served to me was a bit drier than what I was used too and the egg on top was not runny (overcooked?) at all!  I took a chance and asked the server to change the plate because I don't like overcooked egg. They graciously took my plate back and came back with the perfect plate. The Shakshuka was as good as I the one Inhad back when Beni's was still in its old location across the street. The hot sauce and tahini sauce only served to take this dish up a notch higher. I will certainly be back soon to re-acquaint myself with Beni's other menu items.

MAZAL TOV - we have felafel in Manila! you can't get anymore authentic then Benni's he is, after all, Jewish! So everything he serves is Kosher - coz according to Beni, it doesn't get more kosher than him! Gone are the days of the old store (see across the street - it is still there) where the cramped dining often dissuaded curious passer-by's. Yup - new space, more seating, more TV's... So you can rock up at Benni's at anytime (open 24h) and expect a seat. THE FOOD - MUST TRY:- Felafel's (obviously);- hummus;- chicken liver meal sets (its like the adobo in Israel) - the pita - saladsDont count on delivery being a straightforward thing - often Benni's only delivers to Makati area and has a 1000peso minimum Shalom de Benni!

I am a big fan of falafels and kebabs and I only heard of Beni's Falafel while I was in the parlor in A.Venue and I got hungry. See, South Salon allows you to have food delivered so you don't go hungry while they dye your hair and give you treatments and relaxing massages.Anyway, so I said, okay, why don't I give it a try?I ordered a Beni's Falafel with additional hummus. When it arrived, I was extremely hungry that just the smell made me drool. I was like a vampire smelling blood while trying to control her blood lust.I opened the bag, there was a falafel sandwich with a siding of hummus. I quickly tasted the hummus and it was PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin. It was just right. The way a hummus should be. It was definitely love at first taste.Next, I fixed my falafel. I wanted to make sure that every bite would have hummus and garlic sauce on it. And ooh when I bit it for the first time, it was like I fell in love for the first time. It was like the first time I tasted ice cream. Or the first time I ever skipped rope. Or the first time I got an A in school.It was just amazing. Indescribable. I wish that Webster can create a new word so that I can better explain how I felt and what I tasted.Then I find out that it's open 24 HOURS. Well isn't that perfect for someone who works til late at night?

Is it really Arabian or Persian? Not that im really concerned, when the food is that good, who needs to put labels on them other than EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS? Beni's is really quite popular, even though it's hidden behind A-venue mall. I don't think the whole restaurant is around 10 sqm, but it still manages to attract people from all over the city. (And if you'd look closely, there are newspaper clippings and pictures of various celebrities visiting the restaurant!) Beni's is a literal hole in the wall-- could barely seat maybe 10-15 people maximum, and they get pretty full! Beni's falafel is famous for their... Well. Falafel. For those curious, falafel is made up from ground chickpeas (where your hummus came from) or fava beans that are deep fried and served in a variety of ways? And, it's also vegetarian! Hooray for my veggie foodie friends.  Fair word of warning: falafels are notorious for causing bloating and indigestion when consumed in large amounts (as do many other beans). It might be better to eat them in the morning and in moderate amounts. But really, how can you resist after a night of drinking out and when Beni's is open 24/7?? (Just be sure to drink lots of Yakult or  pair the falafels with some Lassi and you're good to go. )

This is a review that I've been waiting to write for a long, long time. A little back story: I'm obsessed with Middle Eastern food. So much so that I try to cook it often at home, and falafel is one of those dishes that I have never successfully managed to pull off, despite my best efforts. Thankfully, Beni's Falafel exists. I don't live in Makati, but I am easily lured there with promises of eating at this little hole-in-the-wall across A.Venue because it's just *THAT* good.BUT! Did you know that there's more to Beni's Falafel than JUST the falafels? I will skip talking about the Falafel sandwiches (which are amazing, and the other Yelpers have no doubt covered the bases already) and move on to the Hamutzim, which is basically a pickle platter. There's nothing like popping fresh olives, crunchy cornichons and a slice of zesty jalapeno into each bite of your falafel sandwich. Who knew that something already so divine could be elevated into a higher state of divinity with the Hamutzim?! I didn't.Also, their Chicken Liver with Onion is definitely one of the unsung heroes of Beni's menu. For those of you who aren't quite into liver, Beni's cooks it in a way that the weird aftertaste is almost virtually nonexistent. I suggest sharing this dish with a friend, and to add it to your falafel sandwich.My favorite time to come to Beni's Falafel is during off-peak hours. Sometimes if you go in the wee hours of the morning, you'll catch the people who have just descended from Gramercy, if you want to do a little bit of people-spotting.I love Beni's Falafel way too much, and I wish it was in QC instead of Makati!","Glad we went in this establishment. Food was amazing. We ordered almost everything in the menu and loved it all.  See pics. The falafel was not the usual try and over powering. Their version was crispy outside but tasty and juicy inside. Service was tops, accommodating, friendly and fast.  The ambiance was pretty simple. No frills but clean and comfortable. Price over size plating was a average.  My 9 year old son even enjoyed their shawarma hummus.  Ohhh the baklava... delicious! Will definitely be back here just before we go back to Saipan.

This was my first stop on my trip! It was one of the only spots open late night! Thank goodness because it is delicious. It's also much healthier than the other late night choices. The hummus here is delicious! I also like that you can order half or full sizes of the falafel. The half size is fulfilling already. If you eat just those two things, you should be quite satisfied. My family comes to this place quite often! I can see why!

A good falafel is hard to find anywhere, but I was amazed to find a superb one in the Philippines. Located in Makati, it is a 24/7 late night establishment perfect for the munchies after a night drinking or just one good food. The falafels here are legit coming in half (3 falafel) or full (5) size order with veggies and pita bread. The white sauce and red sauce are perfect compliments to the falafels. The hummus is a must with the falafel. Definitely worth the extra charge.Service is quick and prompt always. It is on the pricier size, but the quality is worth it. Definitely coming back here for my falafel fix in the future.

Open 24/7, located inside A Venue Mall. Not exactly a place that stands out much since this mall isn't really popular. 190 pesos for their burger special, which was really good. Comes with fries. The burger doesn't have any sauce but the meat quality is really good and seasoned well. They give you sauce on the side that you can add onto your burgers. The burger was delicious. You can taste it with and without the sauce for comparison. They have a full bar as well.

Beni's Falafel had been a popular falafel place that my friends would tell me its the best. We happen to passby here just before going to Batangas on a wee hours of the day. I was surprised to findout it is open for 24hours.So, we ordered their usual feast. The Beni's Falafel Sandwich with addtional Hummus. The pita pocket was filled with 5 balls of falafel with shredded cabbage, tomato, and a spread of hummus underneath. The falafel has a nice, crispy crust with a soft, moist center. I love the crunch and the spiced flavor of it. It reminded me of a vegan burger because of how it was eaten and the filling. We regularly put their white sauce (not the sweet, garlic sauce). The white sauce has a nutty bitterness due to tahini that give it another kick of flavor. The hummus was nice and smooth. It was really good! Beni's Falafel is now top of my list for Middle Eastern cuisine.#TheFoodCrawlers #OngsFoodprints #TheLostDiego

I consider myself a Beni's loyalist since I first tasted his famous Falafel sandwich. Although I am an unapologetic carnivore, I always leave Beni's satisfied without craving for any type of meat whatsoever. I ordered the Shakshuka in July last visit. I was almost disappointed when the Shakshuka that was served to me was a bit drier than what I was used too and the egg on top was not runny (overcooked?) at all!  I took a chance and asked the server to change the plate because I don't like overcooked egg. They graciously took my plate back and came back with the perfect plate. The Shakshuka was as good as I the one Inhad back when Beni's was still in its old location across the street. The hot sauce and tahini sauce only served to take this dish up a notch higher. I will certainly be back soon to re-acquaint myself with Beni's other menu items.

MAZAL TOV - we have felafel in Manila! you can't get anymore authentic then Benni's he is, after all, Jewish! So everything he serves is Kosher - coz according to Beni, it doesn't get more kosher than him! Gone are the days of the old store (see across the street - it is still there) where the cramped dining often dissuaded curious passer-by's. Yup - new space, more seating, more TV's... So you can rock up at Benni's at anytime (open 24h) and expect a seat. THE FOOD - MUST TRY:- Felafel's (obviously);- hummus;- chicken liver meal sets (its like the adobo in Israel) - the pita - saladsDont count on delivery being a straightforward thing - often Benni's only delivers to Makati area and has a 1000peso minimum Shalom de Benni!

I am a big fan of falafels and kebabs and I only heard of Beni's Falafel while I was in the parlor in A.Venue and I got hungry. See, South Salon allows you to have food delivered so you don't go hungry while they dye your hair and give you treatments and relaxing massages.Anyway, so I said, okay, why don't I give it a try?I ordered a Beni's Falafel with additional hummus. When it arrived, I was extremely hungry that just the smell made me drool. I was like a vampire smelling blood while trying to control her blood lust.I opened the bag, there was a falafel sandwich with a siding of hummus. I quickly tasted the hummus and it was PERFECT.

Seriously! It might take quite a while for you to try them all but I undoubtly believe that you will enjoy your experience of eating here one way or another!Will definitely go back!

Very tourist-friendly food court for a foreigner staying in Manila! After my American tummy was getting homesick from weeks of kamayan and lechon fiestas, Hole in the Wall was there when I needed it. If you want pizza, fried chicken, and burgers (that taste good), with a fusion kick, it's there. Best to go in a big group so you can try and share a little bit of everything. My favorites were the Umami Chicken and Pork Shawarma. The cookie place was an interesting concept! If I find myself in Manila again, I know where to go if I have a homesick stomach.

Philippines review #36Located on the 5th floor of the Century City Mall in Makati, Hole in the wall has got to be one of THE BEST food courts I've been in!     yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…The best because the style / décor is very cool, modern and sophisticated.  It's casual and comfortable with a variety of different seating areas.yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…You'll find a variety of different food items to choose from at more than a dozen restaurants with fun names like: Bad Bird, Pho Bobo, Smokey Bastard, Serious Dough, The Beef, Scouts Honor, etc.yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…Of course there are a number of more formal, sit-down restaurants located in the mall.   But this is a fun, casual spot, with a variety of food served quickly and at reasonable prices!

One of the better food halls in Metro Manila today. They have carefully curated food concessionaires which offers great food experience. They currently have a pop up stall called Fire in the Hole that serves wickedly spicy grub that is simply awesome. I got their Fish Head Laksa and although it made me sweat, it made my tummy quite happy. Good thing they also have outstanding dessert cookies at Scout's Honor which helped to cool down the deliciously spicy experience with the Laksa.

The high-end food court has been a huge thing across the globe since the early 2010's, except in the Philippines. Back then, if you've been living in Manila for most of your life, the words ""food"" and ""court"" in the same sentence never really sounded appetizing.Enter Hole in the Wall. I've been here a few times already, but stepping inside its huge hip maze of interiors never ceases to excite me. I'm not sure if it's the thrill of choosing what meal to try next or just the nice aesthetic of literally everything, that excites me more.On my first visit, I made sure to first try the super popular fried chicken from Bad Bird. As a big fan Southern-style fried chicken, I wasn't disappointed. The crispy skin had a yummy seasoning that's new to the palette, very different compared to my other favorites, such as the Chickenjoy from Jollibee and the Pan Fried Chicken from Pancake House. And there's something about their side dishes that just completes the whole meal. The corn on the cob with bonito flakes, sweet and umami flavors melting in your mouth, was to die for. The coleslaw provided a nice acidic break from the saltiness of the chicken. The meal was a fun experience itself.Just the other day, I tried the Pastrami on Rye from Mr. Delicious and it was monstrous--just plain impressive in terms of size. I didn't even attempt to bite on the entire stack, using my fork and knife like a pretentious chick on a first date instead. Each bite off the monster-wich was packed with so many different flavors, though the pastrami still easily emerges as the hero of the dish. And let's not get started on the sweet potato chips. I'm not a big sweet potato-lover, but damn, the portion was more than satisfying. If there's anything I'd like modified, I just wish there was a bit more of the veggie pickles to cut through all the meat and fat.For now, I'll end this review right here. If it isn't yet so obvious, I'll probably be back here in no time to try a different food stall or two.

There are not much food choices here. Different restaurants that offers different cuisines. Foods are expensive and not so good. But the place is very spacious.

My jaw literally dropped upon arriving at this place.I couldn't understand what the fuss was all about when I first heard about Hole in the Wall... That was until I finally got to check the place out for myself. It's pretty much a ""cool kids"" kind of cafeteria. Well, to me, that's what it felt like. Really hip interiors, design, and furniture. I really like the fact that the servers roaming the area provide cold water, and extra place if needed. They also offer to wrap your unfinished food up when they've noticed that you are done eating. The choices of restaurants/stores here are of places I have not seen outside Century Mall such as Bad Bird (which sells the famous Umami Burger of theirs, and their corn on a cob is quite simple, PERFECT!), Scout's Honor, Posporo, Kwongs, Mr. Delicious, and many more! I've gone to Hole in the Wall more than four times, and I still need a bunch more visits to satisfy my curiosity with this awesome and quirky place.Seriously, I'm running out of money just wanting to try all the food options in Hole in the Wall.

Limited choices of food and kind of overpriced. Other than that, place is super clean and beautiful. Best food court I've been to.

""food court"" style place with great dishes. If you're in a bit of a hurry but want good food, check this place out. It's set up in the same way that the top floor of Japanese department stores are - once you get to the top of the mall you can meander through little food stalls that serve some really good food.  The place has a clean, relaxed ambiance and their staff is really helpful. Try the fish tacos at Posporo, any of the burgers at the beef, the umami fried chicken plate (with dirty rice) at Bad Bird, or make your own cookie at Scout's Honor. Fun place!","Frequently Asked Question:

Wonderful outdoor Saturday market. Fresh groceries, fresh prepared foods and some crafts. A great opportunity to try a lot of different foods in one place. Great prices!

Love all the home cooked pinoy food its only a few yards from my condo and when i am there i look forward to going. Got the best grilled food ever the pork, the chicken, the beef and the bangus. Its a must stop by.  Lots of other foods to as well. Goid for families a childrens park to. Salcedo village..i just love this area.

Great outdoor market every Saturday only. I make it a point to sVisit this market every chance I get. Over the years it just gets crowded due to its popularity with the locals and foreigners alike.Bring cash, some vendors do accept credit.

Its a little smaller than what I expected, but there is still more than enough to eat here. Many international food options. Since I'm just visiting, I tried to focus on the Filipino food... options mainly consisted of chicken/pork/skewers. Everything that I tried was fairly tasty (above average), and prices were very reasonable compared to similar markets in the US. There were also vendors selling produce. It was a little crowded, but not overwhelming. I believe that all places are cash only. Note it was impossible to get a Grab car back to the hotel, so I ended up walking.

There are two outdoors farmer's market in the area. Legaspi Village which occured on Sundays and this one, Salcedo Village Market that occurs on Saturdays. I love both these markets equally as each provides a little something the other does not. For me, I go to the Sunday Salcedo Market for freshly cooked breakfast and lunch food. For my needs there isn't much going on as far as fresh produce or small locally made knick knacks which is just fine. I'm really going for the ambiance, people watching opportunity, in a space that is a little larger and more widespread. I think the number of vendors here is larger than Legaspi, but again I come here for different reasons.Makati needs more outdoor markets! Support local.

There's something special about the Salcedo Market that keys me coming back. As Rafik's says, it's definitely habit forming. Whether it's the community feel, or the different aromas and flavours around, I look forward to the Salcedo Market every week. I love the culture and community here. It's a warm gathering, with many familiar faces and smiles. The Salcedo Market features more than 50 vendors, and everyone who comes here has there own favorites to come back to. A lot of the food here is made fresh and most are homemade and heirloom recipes. There are cuisines from all over the world, so you can have a taste of different international flavors as well as local delicacies. Salcedo Market is a place where locals and visitors can both enjoy a thriving community gathering, all with the common passion for good food and good vibes.

Nice crowd, good selections and reasonable price. Not as big as other weekend markets, which makes it great. Reminds me of the farmers' markets here in the US.

It's a must go place if I have friends visiting Manila. For myself, you will definitely see me there if I'm in town. No need to explain more, fresh vegetable, fruits, ginger beer, BBQ,.... you can find everything fresh here, but, with a expatriât price for foreigner.........Great place to hang our every Saturday in Makati!

Its like the counterpart of Mercato in BGC. Unlike Mercato, Salcedo Market opens at 6 AM in the morning and on Saturdays only. The place is situated in a park that makes it a place to bring your kids. I suggest you to here at 6AM so that you can get a headstart on checking all the products of the shops before it gets crowded. There's taho, burgers, shakes, lobster samdwiches, chinese cuisine you name it they have it. I recommend the lobster sandwich its at the center of the market place. Monster Burger was a good buy too and try the lamb shawarma.  You can buy water at the upper left of the place where the event coordinators sit.","Frequently Asked Question:

Everything was so good! It's one of those places where you can't go wrong with anything you order. It's dim sum, but without the carts being walked around. Prices are very very fair!I only got to eat here once while I was visiting the Philippines. Tim Ho Wan has now become a must-visit whenever I visit the Philippines again!

Very popular place but it was the worst dim sum I've had. I think people eat here for the name recognition.

Good tasty food, not so expensive, nice location,didn't have stomach ache . Bad part , 15-25 minutes wait for orders.

It's impossible to go here without ordering the Baked Buns. This is one of my favorite places to go when I crave for the baked buns. I've been able to try Tim Ho Wan in other countries.

Love the food , service and the ambiance . Very good Chinese resto . I always go back !

I always try my best to dine at Tim Ho Wan whenever I'm in Manila for their baked pork buns and vermicelli wrapped shrimp. Had lunch here on a Friday and the wait time wasn't so bad so we got seated in 10 minutes. Hubby and I ordered the following: baked pork buns, vermicelli wrapped shrimp, green veg with garlic, minced beef with egg on rice, shrimp and pork siomai and mango sago with pomelo. Loved everything we ordered and they've maintained the quality and standard of the food they serve. Even after a few months of not dining here, they still taste and look the same. My personal favorites were the pork buns - texture and flavour of the buns were great, vermicelli wrapped shrimp - love the sauce and the thinness of the wrapper and mango sago - can never go wrong with this!

It's out first time trying out TimHoWan and was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. This is an international chain specializing in Cantonese style Dim Sum. This chain originated in Hong Kong and earned a Michelin star. The portions are family style and perfect for sharing. This location was busy, however we didn't have any issues with the wait time. The menu was straightforward, pricing was cheap, and featured a lot of my favorite dim sum items. We ordered the fish cake laksa, prawn dumplings, pork dumplings with shrimp, jade wonton soup, baked bun with BBQ pork, steamed egg cake, sticky rice wrapped in taro leaf, and bean curd skin roll with pork and shrimp.Our orders were served within a few minutes. I noticed the lack off steam carts made the delivery process efficient. Out of all the dishes that we ordered, the laksa, prawn dumplings, and pork dumplings with shrimp were the standouts. The jade wonton soup and bean curd skin roll with pork and shrimp were a bit bland. The baked bun with BBQ pork was sweet and had a crunchy texture, which I really liked. The sticky rice wrapped in taro leaf was simply delicious. And lastly, the steamed egg cake was fluffy and not too sweet.Service was on point and our servers consistently checked in and refilled our waters. Seating configuration is a bit tight.

Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 3.0/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.0/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0Decent food, exactly what you'd expect at a THW.  It's a bit cheaper than locations in higher priced cities (d'uh).

Lol @ people complaining about the line here.Direct comparison to Tim Ho Wan at the HK IFC location:- Manila has more options to begin with, and doesn't run out of signature dishes few hours into opening- Manila has better food quality- Manila has way better service with no menopausal HK aunts running around- Manila has 4x the speed in getting you seated compared to HK IFC- Manila would have 15x the speed in getting you seated if there was a Tim Ho Wan in San FranciscoGet the shumai, baked bbq pork buns, lotus leaf sticky rice, and save the trip to HK.

Don't lean back in the chairs . . .Why? Because they really don't have seat backs. We walked by the one at the Mall of Asia probably 100 times & wanted to try it. We found ourselves in Glorietta and decided - - now's the time. It was a short wait, about 5 minutes. After being seated, we waited for menus. Little did we know that the placemats were the menus. We ordered four dishes:Beancurd skin roll w/shrimp: it's good. My only concern is the beancurd skin is so thin & fried that it was almost like a shrimp shell - - crispy. It's really good with the hot sauce.Poached Vegetables: outstanding. Here's the ""TIP"" - - ask for the sauce on the side; you can use it as a dipping sauce for other dumplings. Veggies cooked perfectly. Highly recommended.Pork dumpling w/shrimp: excellent. We dunked it in the poached veggies sauce, which was great. It's also good with the hot sauce. Steamed egg cake: my wife liked it. For me, it needed sweetness. Really, the whole thing is whether you like dim sum or not. If you do, you'll like it. For example, we were going to take my Brother-in-law to eat here a few days ago, but realized he wouldn't like it - - it's not his style. Service is a little slow, but we see that a lot lately . . . Not the cooking, the waitstaff & really there is no excuse for this. Last point, we ordered a pot of oolong tea; it was good, but I thought the pot was a little small - - differently no more than 2 people.Enjoy.","Frequently Asked Question:

My relatives took me to have lunch at this place.Their chef is from Barcelona whom we met after we ate.He serves an authentic gazpacho which I learned how to make in my recent trip to Madrid.  It tasted exactly the same.The Wagyu beef is not as tender as I know because I just recently had Wagyu in Japan.  The beef here is from Australia which I guessed!I like the ambience, the food and service.  A good place to have tapas Spain style.

If you're posh craving for Mexican food like tapas, then this place is indeed for you. Ambiance: 4 out of 5The interior is modern and classy, while the tables outside do not match the theme; they felt unsupervised and left out. The restroom is clean and spacious; very comfortable to do your personal thing.Food: 4 out of 51. Croquetes de Gambas con Alioli- super delicious! It's crispy on the outside yet very creamy and cheesy in the inside. I recommend you all to try that.  2. Rambla Salad- I expected a circus of flavors for this salad, but all I had was an ordinary salad.3. Spaghetti Bolognese- Delicious, very tasty, and generous serving4. Rambla's Mini Pizzas- Like their salad, these pizzas tasted just like plain breads splattered with meat and cheese. Sorry, but these pizzas will not bring you Mexico.5. Chringuito Sangria- Refreshing but without the umpf.Service: 3.5 out 5We agreed to take the table for 5 from 6pm to 8pm. Three hours prior our reserved time, we got a call telling us that we were going to be transferred outside; we agreed since most of the restaurants in Rockwell were fully booked. During dinner, I went inside and realized that there were still enough tables for us. Take note, these tables had been waiting from the time we got to the restaurant until we finished our dinner. Total score:3.6 out of 5Am I willing to comeback:No. Service to clients should always stand out.Good value for money:Maybe. Most of their food are for sharing, but they did not satisfy our hunger. Maybe we were famish during that time.

Between the wonderful ambiance, the relaxing vibe, and the exceptional tapas at Rambla, I've come back several times, and never failed to have a wonderful dining experience each time.There are some many wonderful small plates to try!  Both the suckling pig and the ricotta gnudi are wonderful; the cataalari bread is crispy, thin, and delightful (despite just a little too much bell pepper for my taste).Another dish that caught my attention as soon as I saw it on the menu was the Gambas on crispy chicken skin.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of the shrimps, and the way they contrasted with the crispness of the chicken skin.  Oh, and both the seafood paella and the chorizo are excellent!Bottom line: This is a great place to unwind after a hard day at work, or enjoy some drinks and tapas with friends.  It's also an excellent destination to head for when it comes time to celebrate a special occasion.I'll continue to return whenever I'm in Manila :-)

Rambla adapts itself to many situations - the after-work evening tapas, the splurge with your date, the group dinner where everyone has fun, and dinner spills into drinks. I happened to be with some of my best friends and their newborn baby. True, we got lucky securing the perfect table on the ground floor of their two-story resto, but in general I'd say Rambla had no problem accommodating us.It may look small as you enter, with tables laid out in an L-style layout around their open kitchen, but there is also room upstairs, where there's a brightly lit bar and an aged liquor cabinet, and slightly dimmer, more intimate lighting for diners and drinkers.Because the exhaust was admirably strong without generating extra noise, I think it's nicer to sit downstairs. A more casual setup along the bar counter looking right into the kitchen, great for solo diners, is possible, and there is room left for wine bottles chilling in their own wine bucket stand.And so we ordered away, because we craved pork, and we translated that desire into jamon iberico and cochinillo. We had mini pizzas with Iberico on top, as well as jamon Iberico croquetas; tiny chorizo Iberico ""baguettes"" filled with a chilled manchego cheese cream, 65°C eggs with potato foam and chistorra, and paella de cochinillo. We only deviated from script to get chipirones (baby squid) with BCN sausage (Barcelona sausage, I think, I can't track down more info about this), and beans.We thought we weren't going to get full, because Rambla portions are ""nouvelle,"" but we were wrong. (Please refer to the Refinery review I posted a few days ago; we went there and had almost no room left for their #awesomely #yummy bread pudding.)Can I just say I loved everything - and I mean everything - presented to us. If there was a way of chomping down dinner in an ""haute,"" civilized manner, I think we invented it. We ate at a leisurely pace, and in that leisurely manner scarfed away the croquetas, the ""baguetitos"" and the mini pizzas, dipped bread into the egg, sausage and potato ""foam"" and ordered more bread, and daintily spooned every bit of ultra-tender baby squid into our plates, while thinking, this deserves to be a main dish, could you serve this in portions three times this size, please. The sauce in the chipirones dish is one of the best tasting things I've ever had, to be filed away in permanent memory.Now, true: if we hadn't ordered cold and warm tapas, there is no way the paella would've been sufficient. They could add a bit more rice, in my opinion - one scrape, and you know the layer of rice verges on thin. Nonetheless: the baby cochinillo, while not as crispy as some might like, tasted perfect to me, atop richly flavored rice, spiced with a hint of cinnamon.I've previously dined with the same friends at Las Flores, their sister restaurant inside BGC, so there was no way they were going to let us down. With a couple of fruit shakes, no cocktails, and no dessert, our bill went a little over P1,000/pax, so P1,500/pax just for dinner is probably a good amount.We left sated and duly impressed.

Objectively meh. The soup and the beef tenderloin tapas were really good, but the shrimp was hammered and the squid looked like it was pulled out of the gulf oil spill. Combine with iffy service, and probably wouldn't return.

An upscale Tapas bar, Rambla serves up one of the best bone marrow dishes in the metro. Served with crusty bread, the Roasted Bone Marrow with Crispy Onion and Garlic Cream is as decadent and rich as it sounds. Trust me when I say it's not for the faint of heart. I first visited the place with three of my girlfriends for dinner and it's a great meal to share. With the bone split into two parts, there's more than enough marrow to go around. You can even request for more toast if need be. But apart from their main dishes, Rambla also serves up good cocktails. My personal favorite is the white sangria. It may look like the girliest drink in the room but it sure is potent! The price range of Rambla is far from your casual dining hangouts, which is why I prefer to head over their for special occassions. Whether it's a get together with your BFFs or dining with your significant other, the ambiance is cozy and intimate enough for good, long conversations.

Did you ever notice how suddenly there are so many Spanish restaurants popping up? Ironically, most of them are owned by the same people. The once Barcino, currently Las Flores group have now given us the latest and more modern Spanish restaurant, Rambla.Located in a corner by the side of the road, you will find a row of some of the hippest restaurants nowadays. The hippest and busies one of them all is Rambla. The design is not the typical and traditional Spanish look as they made it more modern with a black and white motif. I actually love the man walking logo that they used. They probably designed it this way so that it also acts like a nice bar or a place to hang out for afternoon drinks to happy hour even to 2 am drinking sessions. They have a very good selection of carefully crafted cocktails and wine. The only drawback is that they are quite expensive. A cocktail would already cost you P400 to P500. They change the menu once in awhile but everything they have served have been delicious! It's Spanish food with a twist. Their tapas menu is already good on it's own but what I would recommend trying are the Empanadas of Foie Gras and Pineapple Jam and the Foei Wagyu Burgers. I'm a sucker for anything with foie!

Because I used to have meetings all the time at the Nestle building right across, I'd seen Rambla a lot of times, and after seeing it pop up a lot on my feed, I decided it was worth a try.Online, there seems to be a big deal being made about their spherical olives, which are essentially pureed olives reshaped into olive-form, and made to sit in extra virgin olive oil. I didn't know what to expect, but when we tried it, it took a whole lot of effort to keep from ordering more: after all, Rambla had a lot more to offer us. But lemme tell you, that clean, very fresh taste stays with you.We also ordered their 65°C Egg with Potato Foam and Chistorra, which was interesting to look at but didn't really wow, and the Crispy Suckling Pig with Mustard Sauce and Bok Choy, which was as good as any pig I've ever had. But the star of the show for me was the Foie Gras Mousse with Caramelized Apples and Coffee-Baileys Foam. This was a whole lot of flavors happening one after the other, like Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody for your mouth. Too much foie gras usually gives me a headache, but man, did I want to keep eating this. I think you guys will, too.

Rambla is a cool restaurant set in Rockwell that servers Mediterranean Spanish food, specially Catalan dishes. Everything is so tasty and the ambience is so nice that I have lunch there almost every weekend.I always start with the Iberian Ham Croquettes or with their unique appetizer called Spherical Olives, which are marinated in extra virgin oil and literally melt on the mouth. The olives are all seedless and really enormous, with a different texture. This recipe looks just like magic! They are served on twisted spoons. Quite unusual, right? For the main dish I recommend the goat cheese hamburguer. Pair it with one of their signature drinks. My fave is a non-alcoholic one called Sicilian Limonata Almond and Lemon. It's a delicious combination of lemonade and almond flavor - you can actually see the almonds inside the drink. The ingredients blend into an explosion of flavor!   When you finish, you can try their desserts. But what I really recommend is crossing the street towards Powerplant Mall and getting a Xuxos at Churreria La Lola. The owners are the same - and so is the quality!","Frequently Asked Question:
