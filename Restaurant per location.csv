?","Perfection!  Everything we ordered was above grade in a Filipino Cuisine!  Our party of seven couldn't agree more!  Atmosphere is great, clean and inviting...

Hostess wasn't very helpful when asked how long the wait was. The reply was that it depends on the guests. Waited another 15 mins for place setting and taking orders. The place wasn't terribly busy with 3 large tables still empty.We had the kare kare (good with light peanut butter sauce but not enough meat), calamari (bland unless you dip in spicy duck sauce), fish ball skewers, palabo, and pork sisig (nice and savory with chili). Getting the check took 3 waiters and another 15 mins to get my cc back.Overall, the food was great but everything about the service from time = 0 really irritated me.

This time I dine in with my 2 sisters, were we ordered ""sinigang na baka"",kare-kare, & leche plan. Everything was delicious & the service was excellent. We try to come here just before leaving PI to taste different filipino dishes we have not tried while visiting. The ambience of the restaurant was perfect! We all enjoyed chatting while waiting for our food.Until next time.....

Great food and service. The ambiance is semi-fine dining. The wait staff is very attentive and the taste is authentic Filipino-Spanish cuisine.

Good resto and good service . Love the food selection! Highly recommended. Nice ambiance too !

Really loved the food and service here. The dining area is very clean and the wait staff is attentive. The food is delicious and authentic. We had:    Tinapa at Salted Egg    Pandan Plain Rice    Bella Bandida    Jangling com Selo    CerventesAll were very good. Give them a try.

Friends recommended this place for lunch, and my taste buds couldn't thank them enough! Delicious and authentic Filipino food. No matter how many times I've tried dishes from restaurants with classic Filipino cuisine, there's always a dish or two that will be new to me.  I let my friends do the ordering, and everything was terrific. A few dishes were slightly better than others, but I enjoyed them all. It's nice when dining with a group so you can enjoy family-style and try more than a couple of items. A few of the dishes we tried and enjoyed (from what I remember)...* Paella Negra - a Spanish rice dish with adobong pusit (squid) & pork* Sandoval - sizzling chorizo* Leandro -  Laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk & chilies) with lechon kawali* Garlic RiceA lady was selling some bottled fish and other assortments. We bought three different jars with marinated fish to enjoy later in the day with rice--salty and fishy goodness. The decor is traditional Filipino yet elegant with modern touches. Service was friendly and attentive.

One of the best things I love about filipino restaurants are their great costumer service and this restaurant showed us that.  Food is great and the price is super affordable. The best part is they serve unique street dishes like Isaw and Fishballs the way I remembered it when I was a kid.  Definitely a great place to go if you are a Balik Bayan.

I'm glad to have gobe to Resorts World Manila for lunch before our flight out of the Philippines.  My hubby lovea Filipino cuisine, so we decided to go to Crisostomo. And we were not disappointed.Chicken Inasal with Liver - 5 starsI really love chicken liver and this was one well-grilled chicken liver bbq.  It came with the Chicken Inasal, which was cooked just right: juicy and tasty.  I am not a big sauce dip person.  But the sauces/dips that came with the meat enhanced the taste.Adobo Rice - 3 stars I wasn't so keen on the adobo rice. I've had better.  But it wasn't a complete disappointment either.  The rice came with crispy chicken adobo strings and toasted garlic.  The rice itself was cooked with a soft and wet consistency.  It was mildly-seasoned, which complemented the other dishes.Adobong pusit (squid) - 5 atarsExceot for my ""blackened"" teeth, I really love the way Crisostomo makes this dish.  The squid was tender and tasty.  It was filled with spices that made the dish very enticing. I don't like seafood that tastes and smells like dead sea life in a stew. This was yummy and attractive. Our kida were too scared to eat em because it was dark black, but I hope they will eventually get past the color to enjoy this delectable dish.Bulalo - 5 starsThis dish brought back childhood memories of cold rainy nights.  It was one of our family comfort foods to keep our bodies warm while enjoying a healthy dish filled with tender beef, corn on a cob, beans, and pechay.Service was good. Although I wished that the food prep could've veen faster.  But they did give us a heads up of having to wait 20 to 25mins for our food to get ready.It wasn't such a bad wait since they kept us busy munching on the cornick. Our kids loved it so much that we had to buy a whole container for 120php.

Crisostomo is located near the Marriott, on the 2nd floor of the Newport Mall. There are a few of these, but this is our favorite location. The food is traditional Filipino food with their own flare added on to some dishes. The place itself is large and the seats are comfortable. It is clean and the service was very nice.We did call ahead to let them know we were coming and were seated straight away, We started with just a pitcher of melon. We had heard it was so refreshing and it was.We had the Adobo Damaso (twice cooked chicken and pork adobo topped with adobo flakes, kesong puti and kamote) which was so very tasty. The portion is quite large and filled with chicken and pork. I would have that again. We also enjoyed the Paella Filipino (Spanish rice with prawns, chicken, inihaw na liempo and chorizo) and that was my favorite. The rice was cooked perfectly and the prawns were wonderful.They also have some great soup dishes that you will want to try. We did not have room for dessert. We were very happy. Have a great time.","Frequently Asked Question:
