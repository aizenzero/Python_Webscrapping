They were very attentive to our needs & we were given knowledgeable recommendations. Starting off, this location is special because it's located in the heart of Mall of Asia, the hotel atmosphere is super nice--the entrance is basically a casino. Food was spectacular me & my cousin shared all the bites.Calamansi Martini - 10/10 one of a kind!! Might be exclusive to Manila!Chasu Miso - 7/10, super buttery textureToro - 12/10 TO DIE FOR! Must orderSpicy tuna rice - 10/10 sensationalI will definitely be back for happy hour as they have a bar on Fridays & it's pretty much a party with a DJ. Mahal!!

JC is the best waiter in Manilla!  Every course my area was taken care of... every course explained. 5 starsFood however was solid 3 for what they charge and what you get.  Left me hungry.  For sushi the best things was the pork belly and the black cod.  Sushi was meh and about average for fresh in USA.Great presentation but average in the wowza factor.  No Emril bam factor outside the charred pork belly that had the yin and yang of the crunchy crust and the melt in your mouth fat

It's all about the Sunday brunch.  I read about the brunch on the Internet and they had me at the matcha fountain.  The sashimi and sushi they served was also delicious especially their salmon sashimi with Miso sauce.Also they had this Sea bass that was also the bomb.But I really enjoyed the matcha fountain and also their matcha green tea ice cream.A must go at least once if u haven't been.  It is pricey not gonna lie!

Stumbled across an excellent restaurant called Nobu in the Nobu Hotel City of Dreams. (Yes! It's one off Chef Nobu restaurants)After a long day of travel, I dropped into the bar to have a drink. The bartender recommended the house Bloody Mary. It was flavored with hints of wasabi and calamansi. The drink was refreshing and left a strong punch of radish at the end. Excellent! I popped into the restaurant which was very bright. Atmosphere almost felt like a cafeteria. There were only three tables with limited diners eating. The table and silverware were clean. Sad to say, they were limited on the sake selection. I stuck with the house Bloody Mary. Super refreshing!I was starving and ordered the wagyu selection. It was served mid rare with exotic dipping sauces. The meat was like butter and melted in my mouth. There was no need for sauces. The meat was served over hot round rocks and was sizzling. What a presentation! The side was a bed of roasted mushrooms and asparagus. Complimented the dish perfectly. Didn't bother with dessert as I was bound to hit the Manila night scene with buddies.The portions and a bit small and very expensive. I know,  ""you ordered wagyu you dufus!"". I know, but in the end, it's the experience of eating in a Nobu restaurant. So if your up to spend a lot of pesos for a great steak and experience, try it out! Salamat!

I have visited Nobu LA long time ago.  At that time Nobu was already famous however not to the ubiquitous of the present.  I mean at last count there was 39 locations in the world.  There are 3 locations in London alone, London Berkeley St, London Old Park Lane, and London Shoreditch.  It was with high expectation that walked in the Nobu Manila pursuant to my 9pm reservation.  The restaurant was virtually empty.  My jovial Filipino server Miko was helpful recommending their pork sisig because Kim is unable eat a lot of food now due to her dentist's advice.  We ordered the following:1.  Mushroom soup with an eclectic mix of fungi.  It was very light and not too salty.  It was a 7 out of 10.2.  Sashimi Ocean 12 probably named after the movie.  It was overall just OK.  The fish was fresh however not delicious.  I would say it was a 7 also.3.  Pork Sisig was extremely salty.  I could not even eat a spoonful of this dish.  It was a 4 out of 10.4.  Tofu new style basically was some silken tofu sliced up with some sesame oil drizzle on it.  This was a 3.5.  The three oysters prepared 3 styles.  The oyster were edible however that was it.  It was a 4 due to the high cost and low taste quality.  Overall,  I thought the food for this place this place was OK however given the extreme high cost and high expectation this was a huge letdown for me. I would not recommend dining here unless you have a strong desire to say you dined at a Nob

Located in the Nobu Hotel in City of Dreams, Nobu Manila is high class Japanese dining. With a high reputation to live up to, Manila's Nobu is solid, but it misses the mark sometimes. The interior is spacious, modern and beautiful with both inside and outside seating. Unlike other branches in New York or Las Vegas, Nobu Manila is not that crowded. While reservations are encouraged, most nights you should be fine just walking in. Service is very friendly and generally attentive.Dishes are presented beautifully in true 5-star fashion. Portions are generally on the small side, but not always. But of course most important of all is taste and that's where Nobu could use some improvement. One of their signature dishes is the crispy shrimp. But shockingly for such a famous dish, it really lacked flavor. Similarly the toro with cavier is quite expensive, but lacking in a flavorful punch. The tacos are yummy, but very small. Oysters were good. Tuna with crispy rice was presented creatively so the rice stayed crispy. After receiving all our food, we were still hungry and the server recommended the tuna tataki salad. This was a great flavorful dish with a generous portion. I wish all the dishes lived up to the flavor of this seemingly simple salad.Nobu is certainly very good. Great even. But at these sky high prices, you expect perfection and some work needs to be done to bring Nobu Manila up to the level of it's international counterparts.

Amazing food qualityClassics are hereDecor is pretty, very large restaurantGot the rock shrimps, japanese Kobe beef, crispy rice and some sushis.Far superior than many local restaurants which are for tourists thus pricey, but without the quality

We tried Nobu Manila for the first time and the experience did not disappoint. Service, ambience, and food were all amazing, and exceeded our expectations. We will definitely come back soon.

Staying in Robert De Niro's Nobu Manila Hotel? Make sure to check out Chef Nobu's Japanese and Peruvian menu at Nobu restaurant and take advantage of the discount offered to their guests. Since our trip to the Philippines is coming to an end, I decided to treat the family out to dinner here. Their cocktails are inspired with Filipino, Japanese, and Peruvian flavors make sure to try em! We ordered several sushi and entrees to share. The sushi were supposed to be served last but since some of the entrees took too long they served us the sushi first. All that rice made us almost full. lol.Then came our entrees:Mixed Seafod Ceviche - YUMMMM I love the spicy Peruvian ceviche!Thai Satay w/ Rice - This was so good and the stay were tender and flavorful! It was so good we ended up ordering a second one.Nobu Paella - This seafood paella was soooo good!Black Cod - This black cod miso is another must try from here. This is actually my favorite to pair with the seafood paellaCreamy Spicy Crab - Not my favorite it was on the oily side and the portion was just too small.Beef Tenderloin - Another favorite of the night. We had it with teriyaki sauce!Grilled Squid - This dish was presented nicely, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. I prefer the stuffed grilled squid which has more flavor than this one with the sauce.Overall, We had a good meal at Nobu Manila. Amazing service from beginning to end! I was so bummed we didn't get a chance to check out their brunch offerings, but I'll be back Nobu Manila!

One of my favorite sushi restaurants. They have locations throughout the world and I was glad to find this location in Manila. They have happy hour specials and the food was good. It is located inside the casino. They also have Sunday brunches!
