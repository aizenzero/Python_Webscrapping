A small restaurant at the Estancia mall. Very crowded during lunch hour. Because of the price most people there were to celebrate special occasions with their meals.    If you want to get seated quickly just come after the rush about 2 pm for lunch. I have not tried dinner so I can't recommend.The decor is modern Filipino. The food is really the star of the show. It's Filipino with a twist. They take standard dishes and change up the techniques or the ingredients, add some European or other Asian flavors. I am not naming them because the menu is extensive just go and try. It's fun and an adventure. Oh and they have a good adult beverage selections as well.

Local food with a twist. A good recommendation for people who want local food but not something you get at home :)

If there is more to the word delicious, this one is. I so love the food I ordered that I forgot to take photos. But I am not really keen on using my phone. I focus more on the taste of the food. The food is not exquisite but I think the cooks are trying their best to give what they can. Service is fast with friendly staff. The place has nice ambiance. I will definitely come back.

Always a go to place for entertaining out of towners. Too rich for the everyday meal.

Food was so good I forgot to takes pics!  I ordered a bunch of different dishes to sample, mostly because my eyes get big at all the different dishes.  This place puts a different spin on Filipino food to make it a bit more exciting.  Off the beaten path tho away from the popular tourist areas of the Philippines such as Makati City and BGC area, but worth the visit.  I'll definitely return whenever I visit the Philippines.

Absolutely loved it here. The way the executive chef takes these traditional Filipino dishes and then elevated them to another level is so genius. Try everything here! You really can't go wrong. Our crew got to try at least 8 of the menu items and none disappointed.  My favorites... the Duck Lugow and Oyster Sisig. I'd you're near any of their 5 locations, get your Locavore on!!

Best veggie and local dishes in town. The deconstructed pork stew was great.Service was good.

I know people don't typically rave about the desserts here but thought I'd specifically call out the Torta Mangga which i thought was fantastic. Made with mangoes, meringue, tablea, AND dulce de leche, it's a refreshing dessert that doesn't leave you too full. Would recommend if you have room to spare next time you're at Locavore!

This place is great. I love the set-up. The place looks cool, lots of seating and fast service. Myself and two friends ended up going on a Sunday around 6pm. It wasn't busy yet. It got busier later around 7ish.What we ordered1. Kare kare wings- My favourite thing we ordered. Comes with 6 wings covered in kare kare sauce. Comes with mango and slices of other fruit? (not sure of the name) and with two sauces. A white ranch type sauce which I really enjoyed and bagoong (shrimp paste). I could have ate the whole thing myself. The kare-kare sauce is on point with just the right peanut butter taste. Definitely a must-order when you go here. 2. Sizzling Sinigang- People raved about this dish. I don't really enjoy sinigang. For me it was just ok. My friends said it was just ok too. The sauce has a gravy like texture. All the flavours are present but I didn't enjoy it as much as the kare kare wings. However, this too is a must-order when you go here. Just try it out. Maybe you will enjoy it. Definitely not a bad dish. 3. Oyster and Lechon sisig- Um what? It's delicious! I didn't really taste the oyster in it but it was there. This is a must get! I really enjoyed it. The sauce on top is different. Goes well with the garlic rice. But what doesn't? haha. 5. Garlic rice- must have with all of these dishes! We got 2 orders which was good enough for the 3 of us.4. Gabi chips- when I eat out I like to observe what others are ordering. This is definitely an appetizer but we ordered it after our meal. These are good! It has a garlicky taste and comes with a interesting citrus white sauce. We were really full so didn't finish it. We ended up saving it for later that night. And they were still delicious! I wish I could have these as a study snack. I think I will definitely come here again for my birthday. Can't wait to eat the kare-kare wings!","Frequently Asked Question:
