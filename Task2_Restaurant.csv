Over Christmas my wife and I were in Manila visiting family. My brother-in-law took us to The Sky Deck View Bar. OMG, a 360 view of Makati which really sets the atmosphere for a good time. Lots of expatriates there and everyone was having a great time. We stayed there about three hours enjoying great cocktails and good food. I felt right at home there and the patrons were very sociable. Around 11:30 we headed out for another bar but this place is on my permanent list of places to have fun!Tony

Sky Deck View Bar is very popular; it has a nice atmosphere and can get extremely busy.  It boasts a three hundred and sixty degree view of the city that is positively breathtaking!  I suggest you try to get there in time to enjoy the sunset, and then watch as the city lights come on.I've eaten here a couple of times.  The first time I had the Mahi Mahi, which was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful; the 2nd time I enjoyed a local shrimp dish that was also quite good.Service was great the first time, but really bad on the second visit.  That time the staff was completely disorganized - they forgot dishes, and brought everyone's dishes at different times in no discernable order.  At the end of the meal, it was impossible to get the check....Given the beauty of the venue and the quality of the food, I'll be back again, and hopefully they staff will have their acts together.

This sky deck offers arguably one of the best views of Manila, among them the iconic City Hall clock tower and the Manila Cathedral. It's great to stay here in the late afternoon on a clear day, when the city is awash in a golden glow, and also in the evening, when you see the city lights. During our dinner here, we even saw fireworks! Since we were checked in at the Bayleaf, we woke up early to catch the sunrise here. It was a cloudy day, though, so we didn't get to see much, but I imagine it must be perfect on a summer day. The nice thing about this is even people who are not guests of the hotel can visit. So those who just want to see Manila from above can do so here while having dinner or drinks.The food is nice - we shared a pizza here, but it was really the view that sold us. The colorful umbrellas are also a nice touch.

Oh sweet Jesus, the view. THE VIEW.Skydeck Lounge is an upscale bar lounge located at the Bayleaf hotel in Intramuros. It possibly has one of the best views in the entire metropolis, and since the building is in the middle of a heritage area, you know they'll have this view for a long, LONG time.The food is pretty good too, to be fair. Their Beef Salpicao is one of the best I've ever had, their Kesong Puti dip was savory and flavorful, and their Kare-Kare was both hearty and superb. But really, the main selling point of this lounge is that brilliant view. Come at night, so you can enjoy the night breeze while you dine with a special someone. Imagine yourself whispering sweet nothings at your partner's ear while sipping some wine and admiring the view. Unbeatable.

Rooftop bars in the city are few and far between. But recently, there has been a number popping up around the metro and one of those bars/restaurants with the best 360-degree view is the Sky Deck View Bar at The Bay Leaf inside the walled city of Intramuros. Without a doubt, an expansive view of Old Manila, with its historic buildings is hard to beat. On one end, you'll see the recently refurbished National Museum in all its resplendent glory. Close by is the magnificent Manila Post Office. With a turn of your head, the sprawling and well-kept Club Intramuros Golf Course will meet your gaze. With hands perched on the railings of the sky deck, one can't help but remember how beautiful this city really is. Since it's a bar, the place also serves a list of the usual cocktails and a food menu with a Filipino twist. The best time to visit the place would be thirty minutes before sundown, when the air is cool and the sun isn't so oppressive, just right about the time when day turns into dusk.

Great view but too bad the service is horrible! This is not my first time here, and I have always somehow been disappointed with the service. But this time, it was too much and I will definitely no be going back nor recommending this place to guests visiting. Service in venues like this is key. If treated disrespectfully and you feel unwelcome, it's definitely not worth it and it shows a bad image of the service in the Philippines to our friends from abroad.I had friends visiting from France (a groupe of 7) and after touring Intramuros, I decided to take them to this rooftop bar for a refreshment. After taking a long time to be seated because they were saying all the tables were reserved (although the place was empty), we finally got a table after telling them we would only have one drink and leave. They boys ordered beers and cocktails but us ladies were so thirsty we decided to order fresh fruit juices. YES I SAID FRESH so I asked the waiter what Fresh fruit juices they had. After naming a few, I decided to ordered a fresh mango juice and told the waiter not to add any sugar (they often add sugar to an already sweet fruit...). When my drink arrived at the table, I took a sip of it and knew right away it came from a can! Since before ordering I made sure he would only name the fresh juices, I called the waiter to tell him. After denying twice, he finally admitted it was from a can. Sorry... he actually said it was a mix of fresh fruit and a can!! Although I am sure it was 100% from a can. When I told him you can't say it's fresh when it's not, he took it back in an extremely rude way (which really shocked me and he even said ""Okay fine I'll change it then""). He then came back with a fresh mango juice mixed with lots of water... But I decided not to say anything since my guests were around and I could feel my blood boiling of anger. So best to take a step back and take a deep breath hehehe. I am half Filipino half French and I felt like he probably took me for a tourist by serving me canned mango juice without saying anything (sorry Buddy, I've lived longer in Asian then anywhere else!!). Anyway, I find it sad that this can happen and that people sell canned juices instead of the supposedly fresh ones. It does not taste the same and does not have the same health benefits!!After waiting a long time for our drinks to arrive, less than 5 minutes later they were already kicking us out! Needless to say there was no tip left and it is rare for me not to leave any. It is quite disappointing for a place like this to offer such service...

I can count with one hand how many time's I've been to Intamuros in the past year. It's not a really a place that I frequent being far from where I live. But when my friends who live in Manila told me about this great place at the top of The Bayleaf Hotel, I was too curious to let this pass. True enough, the Skydeck Lounge at The Baylead Hotel offers one of the best views in Manila. Its highest point offers a 360 degree view of Intramuros and all the glory that come with this heritage site. Plus, the restaurant offers excellent food choices. It's here where I tasted some of the best lengua that I have had in awhile. I'm pretty sure that the place is scorching hot during the day but I'm also curious how the restaurant looks like in the light. Will just have to stop by again to find out. Maybe stay until night time this time.

The view is absolutely fabulous, prices for someone from the u.s still fabulous, service is great, the time it takes to get to you? Ohhh. We were here on thanksgiving and got it on Christmas. Yup. That long. But would we be back? For sure!!! But at an earlier time. Music is on par with blues melodies and jazz. Glasses of wine is only available in red and white from the house, all other wines are bottles, cocktails are available as well. The view is worth it even if you just have a drink.

Being on the sky deck to look at the night view of Manila, with its golden glow so bright Conquistadors are ashamed to have existed.Sitting in a nice, windy, chilly night with some new Filipino friends you've made with some drinks watching the city glow is bromantic. Day or night, sitting up here will give you a gorgeous view of the city. There are comfortable sofas for your leisure to enjoy yourselves, and, as the locals have told me (and I indeed heed their words, thanks guys!) it is best to come shortly before the sun sets down for some happy hour deals.Either way, I think if you're visiting the Philippines, Manila to be precise, this is one of your must-go spots!","Frequently Asked Question:

The stuffed chicken relleno was scrumptious! It came with gravy drippings that made a perfect combination with the juiciness of the meat and the chorizo del bilbao mixed in. We ate this pleasant dish in a comfortable homely feel of a Filipino-Spanish ambiance, I felt like I time travelled. Moving to the dessert menu, my husband and I found a peculiar yet interesting dessert called Sampaguita ice cream. We were able to split this ice cream into two as it is two scoops per order. As I took the first spoonful of the ice cream. It was surprisingly piquant! A dessert with a refreshing flowery taste! The trip going there was worth it.

There are 2 Ilustrado venues in the same location. The restaurant and the café. My review is for the café It's a nice place for a late lunch in Intramuros. Located in a quiet alley, the café brings you back to the old Spanish era with its decor. The food is a mix of Spanish and Filipino dishes. The food is average and a little overpriced, but I enjoy the ambiance that is different from most places in Manila and the service is good.

I had a lot of downtime being in a pretty quiet town where my parents live so  I made sure to look up some places to eat at in the city on the day I would be back. A lot of the spots on the lists I found had such long waits and/or were fully booked weeks out. I landed back in Manila just in time for lunch. My cousin made a reservation first thing in the morning. His friend met us at the restaurant. We went straight to the Intramuros area right after I got picked up from the airport. Intramuros is a different vibe. We nearly missed the entrance to the restaurant cos the driveway looked like an entrance to a palace. My cousin's friend was already at the table when we got there. We placed our drink orders then followed up with the food choices after a few minutes. A mango shake is a must for me when I'm in the Philippines because their version of the fruit is by far the best imho. It's always the perfect sweetness. We ate family style. I let my cousin take over the food ordering. I was starving so I knew whatever showed up would get eaten. We nearly ate everything. We asked them to wrap up what was left of the paella and gave it to someone outside. It seemed a damn shame to waste it. We did however finish everything else. The pork belly was amazing. The sides it came with blew me away.

This restaurant is located in Intramuros and I absolutely love the history within the restaurant. My cousins and I came here at 10am on Saturday. We each ordered the Ilustrado tapa which was good. They provided a small order of rice with the dish so luckily I also ordered a calamari salad. I wanted some cold for dessert and they have homemade ice cream with distinctive flavors such as Sampaguita... yes, the flower. I asked kuya which one he recommended and of course it was Sampaguita. It literally taste like how you smell the flower, but at least I tried it. My cousin said it's ""lasang patay"" translation is ""tastes like death"" since Samaguitas are known for making leis, or synonymous to having them at wakes.

Food's just ok. Ambiance is very nice. Service is positively good. Our server Chito was great.

This place had great reviews on yelp so decided to go ahead and give it a try. I must say that customer service was superb. They were very attentive on your orders, efficient and very professional. The restaurant setting dates from the Spanish colonial times, you will notice it from the furnishings in its interiors as well as the facade of the building itself. We opted for lingua, sisig & (cows skin). It was my first time to try this delicacy and was so surprised how delicious it was!!! Even their steamed rice was to die for. They had good variety of desserts that I encourage you to try.

We came here for a group dinner to include various dignitaries and special guest from the United States. We were part of the business economic mission to establish and build relationships between San Diego and Philippines. This restaurant came highly recommended as we were in the heart of the Intramuros area. We were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and has a very nice ambiance. We had a pre-set menu to include:-Artisan Breads with Duck and Liver Pate and Butter-Paella Ilustrado-Adobong Bagnet with Taba ng Talangka Bacalao al Vizcania-Canonigo with Sabayon and Mangoes-Ilustrado Lemon Iced TeaEverything we had was good, although I would have preferred more customary Filipino food like pancit, sinigang, adobo... Rather the entrees we were served were more Spanish infused food. It was different, but the flavors were there. We had to order rice separately as the paella already had rice. I felt the portions were quite small, esp since we had a very large party.Nice restaurant, small portions and good flavors.

Came here after touring Fort Santiago, so we were hungry after being out in the heat. And the quality of the food did not disappoint. We ordered: 1. Paella-- super flavorful,  good portion size. Overall: delicious!2.Bagnet binagoongan (pork belly with shrimp paste? I guess that's the English translation?) --- BEST DISH EVER. I'm not a fan of pork belly bcoz I generally avoid eating fat.  But OMG, this dish was beyond amazing.  Flavorful, crispy & chewy, all at the same time! The bagoong added a savoury touch to it. 3. Tokwa't Baboy (tofu & pork belly) - also very good.  4. Full rack of ribs -- meaty and tasty.  Good choice if you're feeling for meat.  5. Sisig - it was good.  It was smothered in gravy,  which was different but made the dish unique and creamy. The dishes may appear small,  but they are very filling.  This was shared amongst 5 hungry adults and we were very full.  Price: higher than your average sit- down.  But definitely worth it!Drinks: had a dalandan daiquiri, which was on point.  Not too strong.  Good dalandan flavor.  Made just right.  Ambiance: nice decor.  Good service. But I did feel out of place in my shorts and runners.  But I was coming from a day of sightseeing & touring outdoors,  so whatever lol

My first visit to this place and we just happened to stumble upon it. I was looking for street food but being that it felt like 99 F outside, the cool aircon was worth the prices. The food was okay, not anything spectacular, but our wait staff (Rebs, I think) earned the 4 stars. I had the bangus and my wife had the bagnet. The bread disappointed because it was just too ordinary. Yet the mango, oh the sweet mango, why have I not had mango like this before. Time stopped when I tasted the pristine flavors that summed up the essence of this country. At a moment all was clear about the significance of this place.","Frequently Asked Question:

My Kitchen by Chef Chris may have a simple, unassuming name, but it's a culinary experience not to be missed!  The food is delicious, the ambiance is outstanding, and the service is exceptional.The menu offers you choices from a wide variety of pizzas, pasta, freshly baked breads, desserts, and many other delectable dishes.  It's simply impossible to go wrong with anything you might choose here :-)Tip: Be sure to begin your dining experience here with ""The Original"" by Chef Chris; this is an uncommonly unique pizza preparation that involves rolling the pizza with alfla.

Learned about My Kitchen through a colleague in one of our ocular visit in Paco Park. It was an afternoon of spontaneity turned out to be a fine gastronomic adventure. It is an authentic Italian restuarant kept inside the Oasis Paco Park Hotel. Guests will pass through the hotel's pool area and the dining area is fixed with an open kitchen. The interiors is seemingly upscale. Price is a little steep but each serving is actually good for sharing. For the starter, tried the Special Chef's Salad (P590) grilled angus steak tossed with greens in sweet mustard dressing. The best-seller is the Panizza topped with five cheese, herbs, arugula and alfalfa. Ordered the Parma Panizza (P790) finished with ham slices, artichoke, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes. The texture is real crisp topped garnished with the freshest ingredients. My pasta of choice is the Penne Roberto (P720). The combination of gorgonzola cheese in cream works well. Grilled chicken, herbs, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomato is a palatable complement. Finished the meal with a cup of homemade gelato in Pistachio flavor (P125). Not to sweet, just the right amount of sugar. Great food and amazing service. The only inconvenience is the street parking.

Last Sunday my friend asked me to be her ninang at her confirmation at the San Miguel church in Malacanang. After the endless sermon by the priest, it was already lunchtime and me and the barangay of fellow ninangs and ninongs were hungry. My first and oldest inaanak (at 25) decided to treat us all to My Kitchen by Chef Chris. I've actually never heard about it before so I was initially dubious about the choice of restaurant. Somewhere in Paco? Okay. Apparently, it's The Oasis Hotel's restaurant. Going in, it didn't scream super fancy. In fact, the interior seemed dated and the area was not well ventilated. Judgments aside, I tried the food with an open mind. It was amazing! This is how the panizza should have tasted like when I went over to C's in Pampanga. I loved the Tinlou which had bacon, mushrooms and onions. And also the Paco one. Texture was perfect and taste was perfectly balanced. We also ordered the bolognese and the roast chicken. I liked the panizzas the best. For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I also loved it. It wasn't too creamy or too heavy, but it was dense enough to be satisfying. The lime provided a great contrast to the sweetness of the cheesecake.I'd definitely go back, but it's so FAR!

About the place: Really nice once you get in, but not in the best part of Manila. We read about it on Trip Advisor and YES it lives up to the hype. It seems to be in the bottom of a hotel, I think the Oasis Hotel or something. We are in Mandaluyong and it took about 40 minutes by Uber but again so worth it. About the food: Best Italian food I've ever had. I got the Spaghetti Carbonara - it says ""the oasis way"" and I asked what that meant and the waitress said very cheesy. I didn't think the cheese was overwhelming I though it was perfect. Great bacon and mushrooms also and the sauce was amaze. Do yourself a favor and order a side of grilled chicken to go with it. I was craving extra protein and honestly though it would be plain chicken - oh no - so delicious. Seasoned with I don't even know but so good! My boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan which was also delish. They brought bread put in the beginning that was very good and we ordered mozzarella sticks which were like crispy spring rolls filled with cheese and tomato dipping sauce. YUM!! We ordered tiramisu for dessert but we were too stuffed so brought it home for later...oh and leftovers, you will have them. Don't miss this gem in a rough part of town!!!

One of the best pizza places in the Metro is My Kitchen by Chef Chris. While not sporting the best of names, My Kitchen is home to the panizza, the brainchild and pride and joy of Chef Chris. Basically, it's a rectangular pizza cut into long strips that you may drizzle with oil and alfalfa, after which you roll it and eat to your heart's content. It's a nice change of pace from the 'regular' way of eating pizza we've grown accustomed to. They've perfected the right consistency of the dough - too hard and it won't roll, too soft it will break down. The best thing about going here is to go as a group. You can try the many flavors of pizza they have, as well as other entrees from the menu. The only thing I don't like about My Kitchen is the location. It's far and traffic is bad going there. But otherwise, they're all aces.

What a fantastic find this restaurant was! It was the attached restaurant of the Omni hotel right in the middle of Paco, a district of Manila. The food was delicious especially the rolled pizza accompanied with arugula & the chef""s salad with with potatoes, capers, olives, eggs, tomatoes. What a rare find in the middle of Paco close to Paco Park. I will return!

Raina and I braved the traffic of Manila and was relieved to be greeted by the warm and welcoming smile of the friendly staff with an inviting pool in the background of The Oasis, but we weren't there to go for a dip--except for Raina. Instead, we were there for My Kitchen at the Oasis Paco Hotel formerly Barramundi Restaurant.We showed up because we heard that this sublime deli in an oasis is the new home of The Original, previously known as the popular Panizza back when Chef Chris Locher Consultant Executive Chef for Aura Hotels and Resorts was in C! Restaurant in Pampanga.Located at The Oasis Paco Park Hotel (beside Paco Church near Old Swiss Inn), My Kitchen is Chef Chris' passion project where he fully expresses his enthusiasm for cooking intentionally leaving us wanting more of his delectable delights.The Caesar Salad (PHP 490) is made with romaine hearts dressed with their classic garlic and anchovy dressing, topped with parmesan cheese, bacon bits and freshly baked croutons.The Risotto Fruti Di Mare (PHP 890) is made with classic fish and seafood risotto with salmon, mahi mahi, shrimp and imported mussel enhanced with tomato, parmesan cheese, butter and saffron. This was everyone's favorite!The Linguini Vongole is a blend of fresh mussels sauteed in virgin olive oil, tomato and capers, topped with shredded parmesan. Mamma mia!We paired The Original Panizza (PHP 790) with a glass of Merlot. It is made with a fine crisp dough layered with a blend of five cheese and herbs, served with a bowl of arugula and alfalfa, perfected with their popular toppings: herbed chicken fillet, smoked bacon, portabella and golden mushrooms, capers, and slices of Kalamata olives.Their Fennel Crusted Salmon Fillet with Pesto Sauce (PHP 790) is bedded with slightly dry mashed potatoes, assorted fresh herbs, and Chinese spinach.To mark a sweet end, My Kitchen served us their homemade ice cream: Blueberry, Chocolate, Coffee and Rum Raisin. Rum Raisin rocked!

Fantastic! I was skeptical at first but the other reviews convinced me to give it a try - I wasn't disappointed. From a unique appetizer (pizza-like flatbread of the owners own creation), to onion soup, peaking with juicy and flavorful chicken, then winding down with a typical (but still good) tiramisu and cappuccino; Chef Chris and his staff have a lot to offer the Italian-cravers palate. Service was very attentive and friendly, but a bit slow on the wine pours. I enjoyed the ambience but I might recommend not facing the windows to the pool if you're not up to some awkward ""visuals"" as you eat your meal. Great dinner - thank you Chef Chris!

My Kitchen by Chef Chris is situated in a discreet (somewhat shady) area in Paco, Manila. Among all the dishes, the ultimate must-try is their Saint Jacques panizza. It's an off-menu dish which makes it even cooler! Lol. The risotto valentino was pretty good but only if you love bacon. The spaghetti con frutti de mare was also quite nice. I appreciated the generous serving of seafood. The mozzarella sticks were okay, but the mushrooms that went with it were heavenly!

Week Day Lunch for just over CAD$65 (2700 pesos), I would definitely say it is worth every penny.  Buffet is spread over a large dining area with separate stations for major cuisines from around the world.  Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Italian,  American, Mexican, Mediterranean,  Burger, Wings, Wraps, Sushi, Pizza, Pasta, Variety of International Cheeses, Fresh Oysters, Seafood section, Carving station, Variety of Salads and most of all my favorite a Huge Desert section.  Well laid out buffet with beautiful presentation.  Those cute little individual portions of appetizers & desserts in shot glasses and Chinese porcelain spoons are not only delicious, they are eye-pleasing.   Serving staff are so attentive, you feel like you have your own dedicated staff just to serve you and your guests.  During our lunch, never our glasses were neither empty nor single dirty plate on the table. Our glasses were constantly filled and plates were removed as soon as they are done. Restaurant hostesses at the front of the house were reminded me of Air Hostesses of 70s, classic, elegant, sophisticated. I can keep going on and on, but to summarize in one word, Café Ilang Ilang is ""Exquisite"".

Cafe Ilang-Ilang in Manila offers a decent variety of dishes. Still, its location could be more convenient for me as it is quite far from where I am usually located. Additionally, some of the food I tried was not to my liking as it lacked flavor and seemed poorly prepared. Or maybe, my bad that I did not try other foods due to my diet regimen.The seating process could have been faster, which resulted in a long wait before being seated. Once seated, the staff was friendly and accommodating. However, the food presentation was lackluster, and the taste was average at best.On the positive side, the cafe has a pleasant ambiance with a cozy and comfortable interior. The outdoor seating area is a nice touch, providing a relaxing atmosphere for customers.Overall, while Cafe Ilang-Ilang has potential, improvements in food quality, preparation, and seating process are needed to provide a better customer experience.

I encouraged my mom to go there for her birthday on 4/29 and she did.  While she said the food and service were good, she and two other people who went with her for lunch ended up with stomach ailments later that day.  My mom had a bad stomachache, my sister threw up her lunch, and their driver had the runs.  In this case, I'll give this place one star.

High priced buffet with a lot of choices but unfortunately does not hit the spot for me.- table was in a dark and cold spot of the dining area. - food was sub par Only a few choices were good like the wagyu If it were cheaper it would be better but for the price they should have better quality

This buffet is incredible. We went to the seafood buffet which they feature on Fridays. There were separate stations for different cuisines plus one for dessert alone. It was crowded but food was plentiful even up to late. Staff is polite and efficient.

Fantastic Buffet in a Grand Old Setting.  One of the most historic places in the city...Presidents have dined here, celebrities, and even General MacArthur lived here!Large selection of local favorites on the buffet.  Some of the food did not seem to be tasty but it could be my preference.Good cheese spread, decent carving station. Good deserts some are Americanized and some are traditional. Many choices, reasonable price. Make sure you ask the staff in the lobby to show you the war room.  It is loaded with pictures and memorabilia, but its not part of the usual tour.

Perhaps Cafe Ilang-Ilang is one of the most underrated hotel buffet options in the Metro. Despite so, it's definitely one of my favorites for several reasons:1. They serve quality food. Have you tried their seafood and meat options. Divine. Everything they cook is cooked to perfection. They are also willing to customize ever dish to your liking. 2. The seating area is all well-planned. You know how intrusive it is to hear the chatter from the next table? Cafe Ilang-Ilang's interior design makes it very easy for groups to enjoy their privacy while enjoying their meals. 3. Service staff is excellent. They refill waters the moment you need it and take away used plates as soon as you finish your last bite. They're efficient like that.

Cafe Ilang-Ilang's reasonably priced high-quality food definitely proves that good food does not always have to be expensive.

Best hotel buffet in Manila. There are only two types of food here: ""masarap"" (delicious) and ""napakasarap"" (super delicious).

I've noticed that buffet foods in hotels are slowly losing their quality. From poor selections to just average-tasting food, most hotels nowadays charge too much for meals that are bland and poorly made. An exception to this is Café Ilang Ilang in Manila Hotel. Café Ilang Ilang has a wide variety of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Filipino food. With the amount of food laid out in front of me, I had a hard time choosing what I would eat first. Their dessert buffet is excellent; they serve fresh fruits and freshly-baked pastries. Besides good food, the whole place has a nice setting and an accommodating service crew. It is surrounded by chestnut-colored chairs and couches and glass panels decorate every wall, emphasizing the restaurant's grandeur.  Café Ilang Ilang might not be the place for casual and spontaneous night outs, but I couldn't think of a better restaurant that offers good food and quality service.","Frequently Asked Question:

The food was absolutely delicious. I can recommend the kakanin mouth watering and  it's delightful.. There's a delicious smell in here,  obviously full of flavor.. i love filipino foods..

What we loved: Food Taste with TwistManam is one of my go to food places for Filipino food with a twist. Their sisig, kare kare and crispy pancit are some that we enjoyed. The food is so good that we forgot to take photos of what we ate. Photos attached belong to Manam and intent is to visually represent the meals we enjoyed. What is just okay: AmbianceIf you're looking for a place to casually meet with friends and family, this is an okay restaurant. However, since the tables are quite near with each other, you would have to exert a little effort to share your stories/kwentos with your friends or family while dining since the place is usually packed during lunch and dinner. What can be improved: ServiceDownside is their Podium branch does not accept reservations. Although their Greenbelt and BGC one does tho. Not sure if it is a consistency of reservation guidelines of Manam or what. It would be nice if they could have an online reservation especially for special days when we want a sure table reserved already.

I recently visited this buzzing restaurant and was blown away by the amazing Filipino cuisine! Every dish we ordered was delicious, including the chicken wings patis, crispy sisig, sinigang na watermelon, crispy pansit palabok, and laing. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone craving authentic Filipino food.In addition to the amazing food, we also enjoyed some refreshing cocktails and the cereal milk ice cream dessert which was out of this world. We liked it so much that we came back twice in one week!Be prepared for a wait upon arrival as the restaurant can get quite busy, but you can order ahead of time while waiting. And make sure to save room for the ube sago, mango sago, and biko panda sago - they're a must-try!Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for its delicious food, great drinks, and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back for more!

The food here is great! You can choose classic traditional or classic dishes with a twist (fusion) style. The service is great with friendly attentive staff! The place is festive and bright, and can accommodate large groups.  All the food was great! The Sizzling Crispy Sinagang was outstanding! It was a fusion style with crispy pork and a creamy sinigang soup.

The food was okay, in general, but the bulalo meat needed more time to cook, the beef that was served to us was semi-hard. The seats are not very comfortable, and the servers were not very attentive - we had to attempt five times to call their attention just to pay the bill! It's too bad, I was looking forward to having really good Filipino food & service.Here's what we ordered:Chicharon bulaklak - excellentGising-gising - excellentLaing - excellentFresh lumpia - the sauce is terrible, this needs to be changed ASAP! it is too bad, everything else on this lumpia was goodSizzling bulalo - I was actually looking forward to this one, I got disappointed because the beef was hardI would've given four stars, but the servers were not attentive at all despite my trying to be friendly with them. I hope this improves, I know that the Philippines is known for it's customer service & great hospitality.Wishing all the best!

Food is no doubt really good. It satisfies my cravings for Filipino food. It would also be nice if they have sago't gulaman in their menu. That's the only one lacking.

FOOD & DRINKS ARE SO GOOD! My family and I came back twice in one week. The restaurant gets really busy and there may be a wait upon arrival. When you are waiting, you can order ahead of time. The ube sago, mango sago and biko panda sago are a must-order! I am definitely coming back for more!

The restaurant (inside and outside) was buzzy on a Tuesday night which felt like it was a Friday. My cousin and his wife treated me to a sumptuous dinner and every dish they ordered was delicious! We had chicken wings patis, crispy sisig, sinigang na watermelon, crispy pansit palabok, and laing. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who craves for real Filipino cuisine!

One of the cravings upon arriving in the Philippines was to taste Filipino cuisines, and yes, we came to the right place; Manam has an incredible Filipino menu and some with a twist. Their location in Sm Baguio is spacious with inside and outside seating, Filipino paintings ambiance as well as friendly staff.Their menu is kinda overwhelming as it mostly comes with a twist and so far we did loved most of the dishes we ordered. We had;Crispy Black Ink Palabok (medium) - I was fascinated when it arrived; the twist was the palabok was fried, and the sauce was poured in it, though it was a lot for us; as soon as the sauce was poured and mixed, it did subside; this was deliciously crunchy, not so oily yet tasty..Sizzling Bangus Belly sisig (medium)- tasty, and a significant amount of servingGarlic rice- just the perfect taste of garlic not so salty and oilyMango+Pomelo+Sago- Large quantity as theirs no medium size my sister did not like it much, said the mango was not that sweet.Ube +Sago- it was delicious I did liked itUbe Bibingka- just the right taste and delicious Puto Bumbong with Muscovado Butter- my favourite that I ordered again the second time we visited. The perfect texture of the sticky rice, the right amount of muscovado and butter and the addition of cheese made it so delicious.Overall, we did love Manam; the price is reasonable but maybe a little pricy for those on budget; they have different dishes to choose from pang umagahan (breakfast), pang tabghalian (lunch), pang hapunan (dinner), merienda, beverages and desserts.It is highly recommended for those looking for an authentic Filipino dish. Check them out. They have branches all over the Philippines","Frequently Asked Question:

Arthur K.","The ambiance and interior design of the restaurant are also highly appreciated by many customers. The decor is modern, clean, and spacious, with comfortable seating arrangements. The restaurant has a lively and fun atmosphere, making it an ideal place for group gatherings or family meals.Overall, Samgyupsalamat is a great restaurant for Korean food lovers, with high-quality dishes and a pleasant ambiance. However, be prepared for a potentially long wait and higher prices compared to other Korean restaurants in the area.

If you're from the US and haven't tried Korean barbecue definitely check this place out. It's located in a upper scaled part of manila. We stayed about two blocks away in the Belmont Hotel and walked over. For about $10 per person us or 600 pesos all you can eat for 2 hours. We were only there for maybe an hour we tapped out. We didn't even eat the sides we only ate the meat and there was three of us and we could not do it. The place is nice and clean the staff is plenty quick to fill up your drinks any side you want and any additional meats you want.

My pork-eating days are behind me now, but when I used to enjoy all the porcine delights that the world can offer, my perfect idea of a hedonistic and devil-may-care indulgence is a slowly paced and savored Korean barbeque dinner. I used to live near Samgyupasalamat, which is an unassuming neighborhood joint that was put up to cater to the needs of the homesick Korean students who live in the condos and townhouses nearby. The TV screens always play K-POP, which adds to the bright and sunny interiors.

They were able to seat our group of 6 in under 30 mins! Great food and meat quality! It takes a bit to get your orders, but maybe it was just really busy that day. It was a packed restaurant when we went but we still had a great time. Definitely recommend, especially for tourists as the water and iced tea are made with filtered water and we didn't get any stomach bugs after drinking it!

It took us awhile to forgive Samgyupsalamat. At their Kapitan Tikong branch months ago, we were very unsatisfied with the tough meat they served us. We used to be regular customers there so we knew our meat.Our visit at this new branch redeemed us as regular customers again. We were so happy to be surprised by the extra space they have at the back; you'd think the branch is small if you only took a peek from the outside. It was a bit warm at first but they adjusted the aircon later on. Walls were painted black even in the restroom. Overall place looked simple and had that hole-in-the-wall vibe. Cleaning the front windows looks necessary though it amusingly matches the restaurant vibe.Service was good since they always got what we needed at fair waiting times. Refills came back loaded with food and the water pitcher really kept the service water cold.The free veggie leaves, dips, side dishes, steamed egg, and soup were impressive to the eyes and tongue. Be careful with the steamed egg because the bowl was insanely hot! We ordered two meats ala carte and they were excellent both in texture and flavor!To the management team:Thank you for impressing us, and we can only hope and wish you maintain the good quality of your food and service. Forget what I said about the windows; they still pass! :p

One trip to Taft is all it takes to get your bbq fix. Samgyupsalamat is as good as local restaurants we've tried in Seoul.

Ambiance: 3.5Mimicking Korean Restaurant is good however it can better if the smoke is handled. Yes, it is grilling most of the time but this one needz improvement as you'll end up teary  eyes.Food: 4.0Unlimited 1 - Pork Meat with 5 choicesUnlimited 2 - Pork and Beef Meat with 9 choicesSide Dishes (Banchan) are free and we love most the steamed egg (in earthenware bowl), Watercress Namul Mu Saengchae (but sweet Radish Salad), the braised sweet potatoes and the green onion spicy salad (i failed to get the name).Kimchi soup is good as well.Korean meats are  good. We had tried the 9 meats but got  2 odd with rate of 1/5, the bulgogi... (Not sure of the spelling) and thinned pork strips.Service: 5.0Quick responses and accommodating.Overall: 4.17 out 5.0

My pork-eating days are behind me now, but when I used to enjoy all the porcine delights that the world can offer, my perfect idea of a hedonistic and devil-may-care indulgence is a slowly paced and savored Korean barbeque dinner. I used to live near Samgyupasalamat, which is an unassuming neighborhood joint that was put up to cater to the needs of the homesick Korean students who live in the condos and townhouses nearby. The TV screens always play K-POP, which adds to the bright and sunny interiors. Their all-you-can-eat weekend Korean buffet constitutes unlimited servings of ban chan (Korean appetizesr), rice, cabbage and lettuce, and samgyupsal, or thin slices of pork that should be grilled on the spot. The staff are very helpful and they go out of their way to assist you with making sure that your bacon strips are grillled nicely.   I would go through plates and plates of the streaky bacon and pork loin, which I wrap in a lettuce leaf with a helping of rice, some kimchi, some gochujang and some salt and pepper.When I'm not indulging in their pork bufffet, their bibimbap is a fun and filling treat. Their pajeon, or ground pork and leek pancakes, area also the best, especially when dipped into their house soy sauce. I would cap each meal with a fish-shaped Binggrae ice cream sandwich, or with a bottle of soju, if I feel like a tipple.

A complete set of side dishes is served upon order of two main courses. Their daepae samgyupsal (sliced pork belly) is my favorite! Just make sure not to overcook it or else it will get tough. Beef boolgogi consists of chunks of Korean beef bbq marinated in sweet sauce. I suggest cooking the beef boolgogi last because its sauce remains in the grill and sticks to all the meat you cook afterwards. For a restaurant that caters mostly to students, I think the dishes are priced well (daepae samgyupsal is Php 240 and beef boolgogi is Php 290), except for the rice which is a whopping Php80 per cup.

This is a good spot to get some Korean style pork. The meat is fresh and the prices are very reasonable. They had an all you can eat option, but we decided on the ala carte instead. It ended up being cheaper and everyone got plenty of food. Some of the banchan was good. The kimchi could be better, but it wasn't bad either. If I had this meal even in Korea, I wouldn't be disappointed.","Frequently Asked Question:

?","My family and I enjoyed spending time.. Yes, we're fine dining, we want everybody to enjoy the food,The food was absolutely delicious. I can recommend the chicken and the flavorful rice it's delicious. There's a delicious smell in here. That was a delicious dinner, thank you.

Ambiance 5/5Service 5/5Quick to plate 5/5Food taste 2/5The pomelo salad was nice and unique. The pad Thai was alrightThe crispy lapu lapu lacked flavorThe tom yum goong was light and natural but lacked sour and tasteThe drinks were niceFor the price I expected much better taste. Unfortunately mango tree is better and that's not even the best here in manila

One of my favorite places for Thai Cuisine in the city, I've tried other restaurants in the city, but this restaurant is still the prime.My favorites are Lamb Curry, Pad Thai, Pomelo Salad, and Mango Sticky Rice. People's Palace is one of my go-to's.

Can I give 10 stars!!! The best Thai food!!!! The pomelo salad is everything! The sweetness and the crunch from the peanuts. And the shrimp rolls... oh man, if only we had that kind of Thai food in the Bay Area. Thank you for a several magnificent lunches! The service is always on point in the Philippines and the ambiance is crisp, clean and minimalist!

Ate here with friends who visit Manila quite often. The food was unmistakably THE BEST Thai food outside Thailand. Good for large groups. I had the whole snapper and the salad. Friends had pad Thai . Everything is great!

Order the crispy catfish salad, koi sao chicken curry and larb gai. Aside from soms restaurant, it's the best thai restaurant for me in the ph.

Peoples Palace is just about the hottest Thai Restaurant in Manila right now and the buzz has been following me since back in New Jersey....I can see why.Reservations are a must and even then you're in a holding pattern for that time. Walk ins are asked for their phone number and then expect another 1 to 2 hour wait if at all.The dining room is minimally furnished,all hard woods and sharp white plastic edges,plain walls,2 modern motifs over the bar and some benign art scattered about that's it. This room is all business.... eat.pay,and get the hell out ..we have diners waiting.Menu is extensive and covers everything from the ever faithful pad Thai to duck curry but we decided to go with the favorites.First up. The pomelo salad, sanctioned pomelo,shrimp,cilantro,onions,Thai basil in a tart lime/kaffir/fish sauce and sugar dressing. Sweet,sour,spicy and shrimpy all at the same time. Very good appetizer to start the meal.The Tom yum was so complex and savory with a spicy bite that gently creeps up on you ....then before you are completely aware you go ""damn that's pretty hot!"" The shrimp as well as the fermented fish belly lends its distinctive taste and I had a ball sucking on the fat shrimp heads.The sautéed water spinach was a bit too salty but all was forgiven when both the duck and chicken curries hit the table. Duck curry was in a red curry sauce that was hot and sour from the tamarind paste, salty from the top shelf fish sauce and spicy from the Thai chili's. Chicken in yellow curry with sweet potatoes was creamy from the coconut milk based sauce with the potatoes lending that satisfying sweet finish. Both of these dishes required several trips from the waiter dispensing aromatic steamed rice from a large metal bowl.The breaded and fried Lapu lapu was next and the flaky meat was clean and  fresh Rare sliced beef with a lemongrass fish sauce was so pungent with all the aromatics that we barely touched it but the fried pork belly salad? Was a thing of beauty.... succulent ,crispy and sweet. I absolutely love Filipino pork.This was a huge meal ( there were 10 of us) service never wavered, food came out quickly but well spaced,prices were high by Manila standards but reasonable by US standard so a good meal....... but.In my mind People's Palace strikes me as having too much of a production line "" get them in and get them out"" ethic and I believe the food reflects that. Seasoning were at times overdone,presentation messy  and some taste become "" muddy"" for the lack of a better word.Go, eat, enjoy... People's Palace may well be the hottest Thai restaurant in Manila but I doubt the best. The quest continues.

Honestly, I am perplexed with the high rating.  I've definitely had much better Thai food in Canada, which is surprising, considering Philippines is closer to Thailand. Anyway, I did not find the flavours to be anything special, nothing like the flavours synchronizing with each other, which Thai food is known for.  Nothing about the taste of this meal is spectacular.After saying all that above, the cost is actually quite high for a Thai place, even higher than the other restaurants around the Greenbelt area which I tried.  Honestly.  The chicken wrapped in leaves was rock hard. I did not even taste the fish in the lapu lapu dish... was it frozen? The pad thai was crap.  It was just sweet. wtf.  The bagoong fried rice was way too salty, it just tastes like bagoong.   I've had better tom yum from a soup base I bought at an asian supermarket. The sticky mango rice was probably the best thing I tasted, oh and the milk tea, it was ok, but I've had better for sure.This place is located inside a mall.  The venue looks all right.  We did not have to wait to get in, although it was busy there for lunch.

People's Palace has been around for over a decade and is still constantly packed with people, holding its place as one of Manila's staples. Top dishes have to be the Chicken Pandan, Pomelo Salad, Green Curry, Prawn Cakes, Pad Thai, Prawn Spring Rolls and Chicken with Cashew. The white rice is unlimited and while the fried rice options are great, I would recommend white rice to enjoy the flavors of the individual dishes.The restaurant is great for entertaining guests, catching up with friends and for small and large parties but be sure to make reservations in advanced. There is also outdoor seating available, however if you are sensitive to the Manila heat - best to reserve to guarantee a table inside.

Food: 3.5/5.0Service: 3.5/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.5/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0Pretty good Thai spot.  Very busy, very posh.","Frequently Asked Question:

Zack M.","Absolutely love this place! Definitely one of my favorite spots. During my trip to the Philippines we visited this place pretty often! I got the Filipino breakfast plate quite a few times and the matcha latte pretty much every visit. The pastries we tried were so delicious. We tried a few different ones every visit to share and they were yummy. The service was amazing! The servers were so incredibly nice and I always had a wonderful experience. Can't wait to come back here during my next visit to the motherland! Also, they accept credit cards here, which is a plus. I noticed that during my visit to the Philippines, a lot of places were cash or GCash only, and as someone who does not have a GCash account, I was glad they accepted card here!

I been coming here for 4 years. Still everything is a 1% best to most cafes i been to. Hats off to MY server  andy he is the best and thank you wild-flour for making my morning

This is a nice place love the Chocolate Carmel salted cake very rich texture and the size of slice ooh good for two. The problem I see in this restaurant as well as what I've witnessed anywhere else is that the Place is to over staffed,  and disorganized lot of confusion you have more than one waitress working 1 table when you pay the check the next thing you know someone else is asking you to pay.. You have everyone looking like they don't know what to do..just stand around. My advice cutt the one's who not putting in their weight and keep the one's who look like they really want to be there to learn and serve. And to give the best experience possible. You only need 1 waitress to serve 2 to 4 tables and send the left over waitresses home or start another shift

The Rada St location in Legaspi Village is our go to for coffee and breakfast. The staff is friendly and welcoming and the food selection and quality never disappoints.

I love the serving in BGC branch, nice location and atmosphere.can do meetings while enjoying their food

Pastries, breads, cookies, cronuts and the jarred polvorons are the bomb. Love having breakfast here. Specifically at their Rockwell branch. Friendly staff. Good food and drinks. Love the kimchi pork fried rice. Downside is you have to oark at the mall.

Really yummy breakfast I had the adobo rice and egg bowl. Would recommend:) only downside is they didn't have creamer or half & half for coffees so don't order coffee that you like to have with creamer.

As one of the partners at the helm is a 3-star Michelin chef, one should be curious about Wildflour Cafe + Bakery and its creations. The team is also responsible for operating some restaurants in and around LA (e.g. Republique and Grand Central Market shops). That being said, their actual printed menu does look mostly Americanized which might not be what someone wants when they visit a new city. However, if you peruse their baked section, you might find something of interest... in the form of ube! I picked through for an *Ube Keso Pandesal* (php 75) and an *Ube Pound Cake* (php 115). I was enamored with the ube keso pandesal as it was light, scrumptious, and filled with some funky, salted cheese. The sponge cake was moist with a faint ube flavor. Their entire selection was so enticing to be honest. I know Filipinos are all about displaying their wares, but I somewhat wished they were behind a splash guard or locked away in a display case. In the end, I never handled any of the bread anyways as a worker came around to pack away my items. Nonetheless, if you can get passed the potential germy aspect, yummy bread you will have the pleasure of enjoying!

I love this place. Coffee concoctions are good, the espresso tends to be sour by itself. Great breads and pastries, food is good, prices are on the high side. A slice of egg pie runs you up in the 275 range. The dinner menu is pricey. Great idea on the different menus for specific times.

This café has nice atmosphere and good food. The waiters are nice too. A little pricey though.

Can't go wrong with any location of this place. Sweet stock of all kinds of delights from freshly made pies, cookies and brownies to innovative gluten free desserts and tasty drinks. This place is outperforming and gives the big boys Starbucks and Coffee Bean a lesson or two on how to do things better. Service is great and ambiance gives off a unique homy vibe. Depending on the location there is outdoor and indoor seating. Too bad there aren't more locations around the city.","Frequently Asked Question:

?","We came for a late lunch, and left feeling satisfied. Like others have said, the seating is outside on the pier, which can be a little warm later in the day. Our ice melted quickly in our drinks. All in all, the portions are decent. Our part of two did leave with some left overs.Highlights: The Adobong Kangkong was cut into manageable pieces and was mixed into a delicious sauce. Lowlights: The pancit canton was made with ramen noodles. It was good, but it couldn't really be called pancit canton with the wrong noodles. Mixed bag: The Caldereta was sweet which my husband loved and I didn't, and our halo halo didn't have enough ice in them, even though they were tasty. I'm giving it a four nonetheless because I enjoyed the little Sheldon like seabird that kept us company. He wouldn't allow anyone on his log, chasing away a rude sparrow that dared to try to sit there.  Plus, the food was good, even if some of the ingredients were incorrect.

What I really loved on most restaurants is those who offer seafoods, and they all have it, foods are amazingly yummy and mouthwatering and most of the dishes are Filipino foods.

This place opens at 11 in the morning. It's next to the Ocean Park, It has a nice view of Manila bay and close to Luneta Park. They offer Filipino food especially seafood.A lot of people will say that it's pricey but they need to understand that the location of the restaurant plus labor is expensive so I understand why the price is the way it is. Also the portion size is good for two people.They don't have their own WiFi but there is a public WiFi that you can use to take pictures for Instagram. They also accept Credit and Debit Card.I'm giving it a 4 star review because there is still room for improvements.- Find a way to open earlier than 11 am.- Have your own WiFi exclusive for guest.- Work on presentation, because millennials like me like to post pictures on Instagram.- Few improvements with the servers and the service.- Improvements with online orders and delivery.Overall I will recommend this place for locals, foreigners and balikbayans.

Slightly pricey but the view is beautiful. I'm so glad Roxas boulevard was cleaned up, I used to ride a ferry here when I was younger.  Food was good but wet also knew what to order.

Good please for seafood. It's not trendy at all and have a good service. Crabs and shrimps are fresh and here they cook it in so many ways!

Quick facts - Don't think they accept cards. - You have to flag down wait staff like most places. - Good pictures - Offers non traditional Philippine food (grilled chez, fried chicken, etc), very accommodating of English speakers. ***they allow smoking in the dining area.*** Enjoyed this place a lot. It is literally over the harbor. The majority of the seating is on a pier reaching out over the water. This can give the place a bit of that unpleasant ocean smell, but you get used to it after a while and we didn't realize it within 20 minutes. There is literally a ton to choose from, which was the one time I felt bad about not knowing the language bc I could tell what I was missing out on.

Food was amazing! We ordered a lot of shrimp dishes and my allergies didn't react, meaning it's fresh (that's just my theory, hehe). Place is very clean and service was exceptional. Price is very reasonable too.

This place is a lousy value for what you pay.  It's an open-air restaurant on and over the water.  The decor and ambience is nothing special.  The service is so-so.  I ordered the wok-fried lapu-lapu with chili sauce.  The flavor was okay but out of a 500 gram fish, I got about 100 grams of meat and I had to work hard to get that much off this poor little fish's frame.  I had a side of steamed broccoli with garlic.  It was served swimming in a brown sauce and it was just too salty to eat.  For all of this, I paid PhP 1,600.  My curiosity has been satisfied and I won't be returning to this place.

We stumbled in to this place looking for another restaurant.  The food was tasty.  Unfortunately, the service was lackluster.  The ambiance is nice and the open air breeze was nice.  If you are not in a hurry, try this place out.

A go to for Filipino food.  Nice location on the water.  Wide selection of food, affordable, quick service.","Frequently Asked Question:

They were very attentive to our needs & we were given knowledgeable recommendations. Starting off, this location is special because it's located in the heart of Mall of Asia, the hotel atmosphere is super nice--the entrance is basically a casino. Food was spectacular me & my cousin shared all the bites.Calamansi Martini - 10/10 one of a kind!! Might be exclusive to Manila!Chasu Miso - 7/10, super buttery textureToro - 12/10 TO DIE FOR! Must orderSpicy tuna rice - 10/10 sensationalI will definitely be back for happy hour as they have a bar on Fridays & it's pretty much a party with a DJ. Mahal!!

JC is the best waiter in Manilla!  Every course my area was taken care of... every course explained. 5 starsFood however was solid 3 for what they charge and what you get.  Left me hungry.  For sushi the best things was the pork belly and the black cod.  Sushi was meh and about average for fresh in USA.Great presentation but average in the wowza factor.  No Emril bam factor outside the charred pork belly that had the yin and yang of the crunchy crust and the melt in your mouth fat

It's all about the Sunday brunch.  I read about the brunch on the Internet and they had me at the matcha fountain.  The sashimi and sushi they served was also delicious especially their salmon sashimi with Miso sauce.Also they had this Sea bass that was also the bomb.But I really enjoyed the matcha fountain and also their matcha green tea ice cream.A must go at least once if u haven't been.  It is pricey not gonna lie!

Stumbled across an excellent restaurant called Nobu in the Nobu Hotel City of Dreams. (Yes! It's one off Chef Nobu restaurants)After a long day of travel, I dropped into the bar to have a drink. The bartender recommended the house Bloody Mary. It was flavored with hints of wasabi and calamansi. The drink was refreshing and left a strong punch of radish at the end. Excellent! I popped into the restaurant which was very bright. Atmosphere almost felt like a cafeteria. There were only three tables with limited diners eating. The table and silverware were clean. Sad to say, they were limited on the sake selection. I stuck with the house Bloody Mary. Super refreshing!I was starving and ordered the wagyu selection. It was served mid rare with exotic dipping sauces. The meat was like butter and melted in my mouth. There was no need for sauces. The meat was served over hot round rocks and was sizzling. What a presentation! The side was a bed of roasted mushrooms and asparagus. Complimented the dish perfectly. Didn't bother with dessert as I was bound to hit the Manila night scene with buddies.The portions and a bit small and very expensive. I know,  ""you ordered wagyu you dufus!"". I know, but in the end, it's the experience of eating in a Nobu restaurant. So if your up to spend a lot of pesos for a great steak and experience, try it out! Salamat!

I have visited Nobu LA long time ago.  At that time Nobu was already famous however not to the ubiquitous of the present.  I mean at last count there was 39 locations in the world.  There are 3 locations in London alone, London Berkeley St, London Old Park Lane, and London Shoreditch.  It was with high expectation that walked in the Nobu Manila pursuant to my 9pm reservation.  The restaurant was virtually empty.  My jovial Filipino server Miko was helpful recommending their pork sisig because Kim is unable eat a lot of food now due to her dentist's advice.  We ordered the following:1.  Mushroom soup with an eclectic mix of fungi.  It was very light and not too salty.  It was a 7 out of 10.2.  Sashimi Ocean 12 probably named after the movie.  It was overall just OK.  The fish was fresh however not delicious.  I would say it was a 7 also.3.  Pork Sisig was extremely salty.  I could not even eat a spoonful of this dish.  It was a 4 out of 10.4.  Tofu new style basically was some silken tofu sliced up with some sesame oil drizzle on it.  This was a 3.5.  The three oysters prepared 3 styles.  The oyster were edible however that was it.  It was a 4 due to the high cost and low taste quality.  Overall,  I thought the food for this place this place was OK however given the extreme high cost and high expectation this was a huge letdown for me. I would not recommend dining here unless you have a strong desire to say you dined at a Nob

Located in the Nobu Hotel in City of Dreams, Nobu Manila is high class Japanese dining. With a high reputation to live up to, Manila's Nobu is solid, but it misses the mark sometimes. The interior is spacious, modern and beautiful with both inside and outside seating. Unlike other branches in New York or Las Vegas, Nobu Manila is not that crowded. While reservations are encouraged, most nights you should be fine just walking in. Service is very friendly and generally attentive.Dishes are presented beautifully in true 5-star fashion. Portions are generally on the small side, but not always. But of course most important of all is taste and that's where Nobu could use some improvement. One of their signature dishes is the crispy shrimp. But shockingly for such a famous dish, it really lacked flavor. Similarly the toro with cavier is quite expensive, but lacking in a flavorful punch. The tacos are yummy, but very small. Oysters were good. Tuna with crispy rice was presented creatively so the rice stayed crispy. After receiving all our food, we were still hungry and the server recommended the tuna tataki salad. This was a great flavorful dish with a generous portion. I wish all the dishes lived up to the flavor of this seemingly simple salad.Nobu is certainly very good. Great even. But at these sky high prices, you expect perfection and some work needs to be done to bring Nobu Manila up to the level of it's international counterparts.

Amazing food qualityClassics are hereDecor is pretty, very large restaurantGot the rock shrimps, japanese Kobe beef, crispy rice and some sushis.Far superior than many local restaurants which are for tourists thus pricey, but without the quality

We tried Nobu Manila for the first time and the experience did not disappoint. Service, ambience, and food were all amazing, and exceeded our expectations. We will definitely come back soon.

Staying in Robert De Niro's Nobu Manila Hotel? Make sure to check out Chef Nobu's Japanese and Peruvian menu at Nobu restaurant and take advantage of the discount offered to their guests. Since our trip to the Philippines is coming to an end, I decided to treat the family out to dinner here. Their cocktails are inspired with Filipino, Japanese, and Peruvian flavors make sure to try em! We ordered several sushi and entrees to share. The sushi were supposed to be served last but since some of the entrees took too long they served us the sushi first. All that rice made us almost full. lol.Then came our entrees:Mixed Seafod Ceviche - YUMMMM I love the spicy Peruvian ceviche!Thai Satay w/ Rice - This was so good and the stay were tender and flavorful! It was so good we ended up ordering a second one.Nobu Paella - This seafood paella was soooo good!Black Cod - This black cod miso is another must try from here. This is actually my favorite to pair with the seafood paellaCreamy Spicy Crab - Not my favorite it was on the oily side and the portion was just too small.Beef Tenderloin - Another favorite of the night. We had it with teriyaki sauce!Grilled Squid - This dish was presented nicely, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. I prefer the stuffed grilled squid which has more flavor than this one with the sauce.Overall, We had a good meal at Nobu Manila. Amazing service from beginning to end! I was so bummed we didn't get a chance to check out their brunch offerings, but I'll be back Nobu Manila!

One of my favorite sushi restaurants. They have locations throughout the world and I was glad to find this location in Manila. They have happy hour specials and the food was good. It is located inside the casino. They also have Sunday brunches!

anon a.","I had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant to others. The food was delicious and i really love the drinks very cold and tasty..i also really enjoyed the atmosphere..food is 10/10ambiance 10/10

The food menu looks good reminds me of my local bar back in Canada. They even have a BBQ grill at the front. Only sad part was no running water to wash hands and washroom sucks, no toilet paper.

This bar is near and dear to us Peace Corps Volunteers. The staff is amazing and always ensuring every patron has a good time. The mixed drinks and beer never disappoint...and the overall ambiance makes for the perfect evening with friends Now I know Malate is not known for being the best area, but don't let the reputation deter you from truly enjoying the hidden gems located in the 'hood. Oarhouse is the place to be. One of their most popular cocktails is the fresh mango daiquiris. Absolutely amazing! You will find yourself committing to multiple orders of pitchers of these creeper drinks ;). The best part is it is only 350php for a large pitcher, which is the perfect thing to split if you're with a group. The place opens at 4pm so come early since the mango daiquiris run out rather quickly ;)!

This is my favorite pub/bar that I've ever been to here in Manila. The food is great and the staff are very accommodating, nice folk. It's great for when you just want to sit and talk or not talk and just sip on a beer.

Oarhouse Pub of Manila is a popular watering hole of local and foreign journalists in the Philippine capital. This is No. 1 on my bucket list when I visit Manila later this year. See you there!

It's a nice quiet bar mostly college crowd when I was there, beer prices good and it looks like they make their own brew. The food menu looks good reminds me of my local bar back in Canada. They even have a BBQ grill at the front. Only sad part was no running water to wash hands and washroom sucks, no toilet paper.

If it wasn't because of my friend's photo that was included in an exhibitat Oarhouse, I prolly wouldn't knew this place exists! Haha. Loser me.This 2-storey pub was adorned with antique picture frames, brick walls,in-can drinks, paintings, mirrored wall (which gave me an 80's barber shopfeels), old-fashioned bar stools, and a huge LCD tv. Something old, somethingnew. Something borrowed, something blue. One of their cornered walls wasdedicated to art exhibits and my friend was ecstatic to have her photo gotincluded on it. Yipee! :D Since I was with my photographer friend, we were ableto meet the humble owner of the pub, Mr Ben Razon, whose father was the one whostarted the famous Filipino-owned Razon's. We were all thrilled when wediscovered that my friend and Mr Razon both hailed in Pampanga. Yep, yep, smallworld! After the chat with the owner, I instantly felt at home. He shared thatPNoy's photographer was seated few tables away from us and from there I knewthat Oarhouse is a home of artists - true-blue or aspiring ones. And I'm surethe artists are glad that Oarhouse is there to showcase their talent.We were assisted by Evelyn who smiled at us sweetly like we were regulars.She was very accommodating and never missed our requests.This is the perfect place to chill after work; perfect place to catch upwith friends without shouting at each other because the music's volume was just right;if I were just living around the area this could've pass as my 3rd home, next tomy favorite coffee place. The food and drinks were affordable. The place wascentralized but you can smoke inside.We were billed around P600 for a pitcher of Amaretto Sour, plate ofNachos and few rounds of beer. Truly affordable!

Gotta love dumb luck! We ended up cancelling the Thai Island (Railey, Ko Samui, Ko Phi Phi) leg of our SE Asia trip due to monsoons and ended up with a 12-hour layover in Manila on the way to Boricay. After having dinner at an Aristocrat location and a few drinks at the now-defunct Shipyard around the corner, we ended up at this establishment. Little did we know how expat-friendly it was, or that Anthony Bourdain himself drank here during an episode of Parts Unknown! Quintessential neighborhood bar, right here. After a few San Miguels, we met some friendly (and gorgeous) Filipino medical students (Hey Julie). This made us decide it would be best to order a communal pitcher for all of us. Opted for the Weng Weng, which is essentially a more tropical Filipino Long Island. It was deadly, but delicious. Certainly made for a lovely evening. They also have other cocktail options and your standard San Miguel beer offerings, plus some local craft beer I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu. Most def the bar to hit up if you're an American in Manila. The bartender was incredibly welcoming and friendly, as well. Too bad they're Steelers fans...

It's an OK place but I would not say great. If.you need a rest from the surrounding area, then this would be a good place for that. the prices are decent and the staff is good. The reason I say not great because it is missing character. In fact, it seems more like a fast food place.","Frequently Asked Question:

The authentic shawarma recipe is what set them apart from other middle eastern restaurants. The price points is actually affordable with a wide range of menu to choose from.

See, I loooove falafels. I also happen to be vegan, so I love veggies.

I first encountered Shawarma Snack Center at the outskirts of BF Parañaque, during the height of the Shawarma Craze (For you millennials out there, that happened around the time most of you were born). Nowadays, there are a lot of middle eastern places in the city, and the offerings have become more diverse and authentic. Having said that, when I rediscovered SSC in Malate (It's the original one raw), it was like bumping into a long, lost friend. This time around, I ordered a combo keema plate for P250. It's borderline mahal for what you're getting, but it was pretty good and solid. I like the fact they have an aircon zone, but I avoided it because I didn't want to smell like the Mediterranean (Read: Meat). Still, I had a wonderful dinner over there, and I appreciate the fact I'm finding more and more reasons to hang out in Malate again.

This branch has the most extensive menu across all their other branches that I know of, and the only one I've been to that has FALAFELS. See, I loooove falafels. I also happen to be vegan, so I love veggies. Veggies you say? Falafels are super tasty fried balls made of chickpeas! A lot of my meat-eater friends actually thought falafels are meat! For Php 85 you can get a decent-sized falafel sandwich. This one is different from the other falafels I've had in the metro, since this one has pickled vegetables inside. Something new and tangy for my tastebuds, but still very satisfying. Their falafels are very flavorful (and a tad bit salty for my taste, but still tasty!). Great meal, heavy enough for lunch if I might say so. This branch also sells some middle-Eastern food products. Check out the shelf by the door! They have canned hummus!

Anytime I am in Malate, I make sure to get my Shawarma Snack Center fix. The place offers a laid-back ambiance where you can enjoy delicious food and hookah with friends. While they are known for their falafels and shawarma plates, which are delicious, the fresh fruit shakes are something to consider as well. My personal favorite is the green mango shake. Another great thing about this place is it is open 24 hours...so if you need something to soak up all the alcohol from your barhopping, this is the place to go ;).For those of you that enjoy a beer or alcoholic beverage with your meal, keep in mind that no alcohol is served here!

This restaurant took me back to the Middle East in a matter of minutes. From their slightly shabby interiors (not their strongest suit, in my opinion) to  every single bite I took from their food. I visited this place with my husband, who can be quite a snob when it comes to Middle Eastern restos in Manila (to be fair, he tasted a good number of shawarmas and hummus while living in the Middle East for six years). He ordered a plate of shawarma (that came with fries and some pickled veggies, so legit) while I ordered a full set of beef kebabs and rice. I was expecting him to make his usual snarky comment on the food like he did with the previous shawarmas that disappointed him, but he didn't. Instead, he ordered another plate. I downed my kebabs, btw. That plate was really big enough for sharing, but I was really hungry and the meat was really good. We paired our food with our chosen fruit shakes and there's just something about the way the Arabs make their shakes that's just so refreshing. I felt like I was eating in Lebanese Flower, my go-to place in Abu Dhabi. To say we were stuffed is definitely an understatement. We paid more than our usual lunch budget, but it was worth it. I can't wait to go to their BF branch soon.

Good place for middle eastern food. U know its good when arabs eat there. My only gripe was the waitress that broke a small glass that was pretty heavy on my wife shoulder. She never apologize and wife was very upset as she was in pain throughout the day.

I love their 3 shawarmas for 150 and their hummus too. I hate the chicken shawarma with rice. The chicken was too dry.I'll come back another time to try their other dishes.

Being a just a humble tourist in Manila, I have no idea how Shawarma Snack Center stacks up to its local competition. As someone whose international shawarma experience includes Istanbul, Moscow, Tbilisi, and my home state of CA, I feel like I can provide some helpful feedback. We were first a little confused which restaurant I had bookmarked. There's two Shawarma Snack Centers across the street from each other. One looks more sit-down restaurant-y, and the other caters to take-out and has a small air-conditioned room with plastic tables and chairs. We opted for the cheaper of the two and ordered a shawarma and kebab plate. The shawarma meat and wrap were both on the dry side and lacked the burst of flavor I'm accustomed to. The kebab wasn't much better, but it did have a little more flavor and came with rice. Portions reflect the name; closer to snack size. It was definitely an affordable meal and one of the cheapest we had in Manila. I'm not sure I'd come back the next time I'm in town unless I'm in this area and as it's open 24-hours, probably as a late-night snack. It looks like the restaurant SSC across the street is more promising with larger portions and more menu options.","Frequently Asked Question:

?","Perfection!  Everything we ordered was above grade in a Filipino Cuisine!  Our party of seven couldn't agree more!  Atmosphere is great, clean and inviting...

Hostess wasn't very helpful when asked how long the wait was. The reply was that it depends on the guests. Waited another 15 mins for place setting and taking orders. The place wasn't terribly busy with 3 large tables still empty.We had the kare kare (good with light peanut butter sauce but not enough meat), calamari (bland unless you dip in spicy duck sauce), fish ball skewers, palabo, and pork sisig (nice and savory with chili). Getting the check took 3 waiters and another 15 mins to get my cc back.Overall, the food was great but everything about the service from time = 0 really irritated me.

This time I dine in with my 2 sisters, were we ordered ""sinigang na baka"",kare-kare, & leche plan. Everything was delicious & the service was excellent. We try to come here just before leaving PI to taste different filipino dishes we have not tried while visiting. The ambience of the restaurant was perfect! We all enjoyed chatting while waiting for our food.Until next time.....

Great food and service. The ambiance is semi-fine dining. The wait staff is very attentive and the taste is authentic Filipino-Spanish cuisine.

Good resto and good service . Love the food selection! Highly recommended. Nice ambiance too !

Really loved the food and service here. The dining area is very clean and the wait staff is attentive. The food is delicious and authentic. We had:    Tinapa at Salted Egg    Pandan Plain Rice    Bella Bandida    Jangling com Selo    CerventesAll were very good. Give them a try.

Friends recommended this place for lunch, and my taste buds couldn't thank them enough! Delicious and authentic Filipino food. No matter how many times I've tried dishes from restaurants with classic Filipino cuisine, there's always a dish or two that will be new to me.  I let my friends do the ordering, and everything was terrific. A few dishes were slightly better than others, but I enjoyed them all. It's nice when dining with a group so you can enjoy family-style and try more than a couple of items. A few of the dishes we tried and enjoyed (from what I remember)...* Paella Negra - a Spanish rice dish with adobong pusit (squid) & pork* Sandoval - sizzling chorizo* Leandro -  Laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk & chilies) with lechon kawali* Garlic RiceA lady was selling some bottled fish and other assortments. We bought three different jars with marinated fish to enjoy later in the day with rice--salty and fishy goodness. The decor is traditional Filipino yet elegant with modern touches. Service was friendly and attentive.

One of the best things I love about filipino restaurants are their great costumer service and this restaurant showed us that.  Food is great and the price is super affordable. The best part is they serve unique street dishes like Isaw and Fishballs the way I remembered it when I was a kid.  Definitely a great place to go if you are a Balik Bayan.

I'm glad to have gobe to Resorts World Manila for lunch before our flight out of the Philippines.  My hubby lovea Filipino cuisine, so we decided to go to Crisostomo. And we were not disappointed.Chicken Inasal with Liver - 5 starsI really love chicken liver and this was one well-grilled chicken liver bbq.  It came with the Chicken Inasal, which was cooked just right: juicy and tasty.  I am not a big sauce dip person.  But the sauces/dips that came with the meat enhanced the taste.Adobo Rice - 3 stars I wasn't so keen on the adobo rice. I've had better.  But it wasn't a complete disappointment either.  The rice came with crispy chicken adobo strings and toasted garlic.  The rice itself was cooked with a soft and wet consistency.  It was mildly-seasoned, which complemented the other dishes.Adobong pusit (squid) - 5 atarsExceot for my ""blackened"" teeth, I really love the way Crisostomo makes this dish.  The squid was tender and tasty.  It was filled with spices that made the dish very enticing. I don't like seafood that tastes and smells like dead sea life in a stew. This was yummy and attractive. Our kida were too scared to eat em because it was dark black, but I hope they will eventually get past the color to enjoy this delectable dish.Bulalo - 5 starsThis dish brought back childhood memories of cold rainy nights.  It was one of our family comfort foods to keep our bodies warm while enjoying a healthy dish filled with tender beef, corn on a cob, beans, and pechay.Service was good. Although I wished that the food prep could've veen faster.  But they did give us a heads up of having to wait 20 to 25mins for our food to get ready.It wasn't such a bad wait since they kept us busy munching on the cornick. Our kids loved it so much that we had to buy a whole container for 120php.

Crisostomo is located near the Marriott, on the 2nd floor of the Newport Mall. There are a few of these, but this is our favorite location. The food is traditional Filipino food with their own flare added on to some dishes. The place itself is large and the seats are comfortable. It is clean and the service was very nice.We did call ahead to let them know we were coming and were seated straight away, We started with just a pitcher of melon. We had heard it was so refreshing and it was.We had the Adobo Damaso (twice cooked chicken and pork adobo topped with adobo flakes, kesong puti and kamote) which was so very tasty. The portion is quite large and filled with chicken and pork. I would have that again. We also enjoyed the Paella Filipino (Spanish rice with prawns, chicken, inihaw na liempo and chorizo) and that was my favorite. The rice was cooked perfectly and the prawns were wonderful.They also have some great soup dishes that you will want to try. We did not have room for dessert. We were very happy. Have a great time.","Frequently Asked Question:

Czarra P.","If you're looking for an exclusive and classic Filipino food, this is the place to go. La Cocina de Tita Moning is stellar and in it's A game if we're talking about Filipino food! Right when you enter the house, the waitress offers you a complimentary lemongrass iced tea and grilled queso de bola bites on pieces of bread to tie you over for the house tour. House tour?! Yes! La Cocina de Tita Moning's is in an old house near Malacanang Palace therefore there is a tour guide to tell you all about the history and trivia about the Philippines especially during Marcos' time. The house is two floors and it's incredibly big. Each room was preserved including the things of the previous owners. But what else makes this restaurant so classy? Well, you have to reserve weeks before your actual date because many people fight for a slot on the reservation list! After the house tour, you are escorted to your table where you will be served a 5 course meal. The steamed lapu-lapu was the best. In fact, it was the best lapu-lapu I've ever eaten in my life. Then the egg plant with tomatoes were egg-cellent too! The paella valencianca had salted egg to it which added a very interesting Filipino twist to it. The roasted pork was so delicious also it wasn't dry and it didn't need much of the sauce because the meat itself was packed with taste already. Lastly the dessert, the bread pudding is something I could eat all day long! It was so saturated and soft that it melted in my mouth all at once. The calamansi tart was very interesting because it was sweet but sour. I also had a small cup of hot chocolate together with the vanilla ice cream which was of course, homemade. It was a wonderful experience here! It's worth saving up for, for sure!

A stone's throw away from Malacañang is one of the city's best-kept dining experiences, La Cocina de Tita Moning. Housed in an old, Spanish-style ancestral home is a fine-dining experience like no other. Once you enter the mansion, guests are offered a tour around the house and one can't help but imagine the grand parties that took place in those hallowed halls many decades before. I couldn't help but be fascinated by the objects in the rooms that we visited. One room was filled with hospital instruments and even a skeleton, revealing the fact that the master of the house was a doctor. Another room, filled with vintage cameras of all kinds showed that he was also a shutterbug. The living rooms of the place still had magnificence to them and I wished to have experienced the place in its heyday, even for just a little bit. We were then led to a private room where we had a sampling of Spanish-style dishes that were served in the days of yore. They were made even more delicious by the history that each bite contained.

Nothing speaks of good food like eating in someone's home, you get the best tasting and prepared with the most love dishes you won't find anywhere else! In the middle of, no less than, the Malacanang Compound you'll find Cosina de Tita Moning. This heritage house owned by the Legardas will treat you the best dishes while stepping back in time. You'll have to reserve yourself a table before making a visit, it's great for family celebrations or romantic dinners! The dinner usually starts in their garden with cocktails and pica-pica, the atmosphere is so refreshing you wouldn't believe that the main attraction hasn't even started. This house turned restaurant is also a museum, so a guided tour usually comes next, you'll find a nice library, old ternos, even a skeleton! The house holds stories from many generations back! When you finally get to your table the dinner is usually carefully plated and served in courses. Besides being so overwhelmed  with the whole experience, the food is actually very delicious! The service here is also very on point, with no one other than the family's help serving you, they really treat you like family! It's a great experience for Filipinos and visitors alike, it's always worth a trip here!

Time travel and food is not a common combination to have, but stepping inside La Cocina De Tita Moning is to be transported back to Manila's opulent past. The restaurant-cum-ancestral house offers patrons a dining experience like no other.  To start things off, you are given a tour of the mansion and told tidbits and stories pertaining to the Legarda family. The tour starts in the first floor and you gradually make your way up where you'll eventually be led to the dining area. Describing it as extravagant and exquisite is putting it mildly. There are rose petals strewn about the length of your table. There are literal bells you can pick up and ring to get the attention of the help. The whole experience is surreal.The food itself isn't bad. It's obviously inclined towards Spanish fare given the Legarda family's heritage. It's not the best though. Paying a visit to La Cocina De Tita Moning is something I'd recommend. Not for the food, but for the whole experience involved as a whole.

In true blue grandiose Filipino fashion, La Cocina De Tita Moning serves up some amazing traditional Filipino food. It's like stepping back into time and entering an opulent Filipino home and sampling Filipino food from an era where tradition and taste are married into a delicious fusion of flavors. For those of you looking for a different yet impressive experience of Filipino Cuisine, La Cocina de Tita Moning is the right choice. You will splurge a little but the experience of touring such a well-preserved house and then being able to dine in such a historical building is just absolutely magical and stunning. History buffs will delight in having the house tour before the meal is served. The ambiance is exclusive and memorable. The staff and service are both well trained and attentive. So amiable and competent, you will just delight in the experience of it all. The food is delectable with the feeling of nostalgia tantalizing your tastebuds. If you enjoy Filipino food with some Spanish touches, you don't mind taking your time nor spending a little bit for it, then I see that this is one place to most definitely one that is to last til the test of time!","Frequently Asked Question:

A small restaurant at the Estancia mall. Very crowded during lunch hour. Because of the price most people there were to celebrate special occasions with their meals.    If you want to get seated quickly just come after the rush about 2 pm for lunch. I have not tried dinner so I can't recommend.The decor is modern Filipino. The food is really the star of the show. It's Filipino with a twist. They take standard dishes and change up the techniques or the ingredients, add some European or other Asian flavors. I am not naming them because the menu is extensive just go and try. It's fun and an adventure. Oh and they have a good adult beverage selections as well.

Local food with a twist. A good recommendation for people who want local food but not something you get at home :)

If there is more to the word delicious, this one is. I so love the food I ordered that I forgot to take photos. But I am not really keen on using my phone. I focus more on the taste of the food. The food is not exquisite but I think the cooks are trying their best to give what they can. Service is fast with friendly staff. The place has nice ambiance. I will definitely come back.

Always a go to place for entertaining out of towners. Too rich for the everyday meal.

Food was so good I forgot to takes pics!  I ordered a bunch of different dishes to sample, mostly because my eyes get big at all the different dishes.  This place puts a different spin on Filipino food to make it a bit more exciting.  Off the beaten path tho away from the popular tourist areas of the Philippines such as Makati City and BGC area, but worth the visit.  I'll definitely return whenever I visit the Philippines.

Absolutely loved it here. The way the executive chef takes these traditional Filipino dishes and then elevated them to another level is so genius. Try everything here! You really can't go wrong. Our crew got to try at least 8 of the menu items and none disappointed.  My favorites... the Duck Lugow and Oyster Sisig. I'd you're near any of their 5 locations, get your Locavore on!!

Best veggie and local dishes in town. The deconstructed pork stew was great.Service was good.

I know people don't typically rave about the desserts here but thought I'd specifically call out the Torta Mangga which i thought was fantastic. Made with mangoes, meringue, tablea, AND dulce de leche, it's a refreshing dessert that doesn't leave you too full. Would recommend if you have room to spare next time you're at Locavore!

This place is great. I love the set-up. The place looks cool, lots of seating and fast service. Myself and two friends ended up going on a Sunday around 6pm. It wasn't busy yet. It got busier later around 7ish.What we ordered1. Kare kare wings- My favourite thing we ordered. Comes with 6 wings covered in kare kare sauce. Comes with mango and slices of other fruit? (not sure of the name) and with two sauces. A white ranch type sauce which I really enjoyed and bagoong (shrimp paste). I could have ate the whole thing myself. The kare-kare sauce is on point with just the right peanut butter taste. Definitely a must-order when you go here. 2. Sizzling Sinigang- People raved about this dish. I don't really enjoy sinigang. For me it was just ok. My friends said it was just ok too. The sauce has a gravy like texture. All the flavours are present but I didn't enjoy it as much as the kare kare wings. However, this too is a must-order when you go here. Just try it out. Maybe you will enjoy it. Definitely not a bad dish. 3. Oyster and Lechon sisig- Um what? It's delicious! I didn't really taste the oyster in it but it was there. This is a must get! I really enjoyed it. The sauce on top is different. Goes well with the garlic rice. But what doesn't? haha. 5. Garlic rice- must have with all of these dishes! We got 2 orders which was good enough for the 3 of us.4. Gabi chips- when I eat out I like to observe what others are ordering. This is definitely an appetizer but we ordered it after our meal. These are good! It has a garlicky taste and comes with a interesting citrus white sauce. We were really full so didn't finish it. We ended up saving it for later that night. And they were still delicious! I wish I could have these as a study snack. I think I will definitely come here again for my birthday. Can't wait to eat the kare-kare wings!","Frequently Asked Question:

Tristan R.","As a law student, finding a great coffee shop where I can hunker down and study in comfort is a must. Cafe-UK should be the poster child for the kind of place I'm talking about.Cafe-UK is one of those cafes that manages to establish it's own identity able to set itself apart from the generic or those that aspire to be a copycat of Starbucks.They have tea, coffee, juice, and a wide variety of American canned drinks that you won't find in your local grocery. There's a lot of food to choose from. They're a bit pricey, but the size and the taste will more than make up for it.Cafe UK has some of the best cakes I've ever had. Their cakes come in the form of a slice or a mini cake. I love the fact that they offer several kinds of cheesecake with the triple chocolate cheesecake being my favorite, I mean it's cheesecake and chocolate come on!Cafe UK is open 24 hours, and becomes a great places to study at around nine in the evening. Things are quiet at this hour up to around ten in the morning the following day, at which point it becomes a melting pot for the different students from the different schools that populate Mendiola.Wi-fi is free, which is probably another reason why so many students love to congregate at this awesome cafe. The biggest quirk that this cafe has that I don't find anywhere else are the free to use iPads. Never have I walked into a cafe that has free to use iPads, These iPads are ingeniously built into the table, I often find students spending a lot of their time drinking their orders and playing the latest games on Cafe UK's tablet.Free WiFi, excellent food and drinks, wonderful prompt service, and the tablets allows Cafe UK to deliver a great experience. Go for a visit sometime and I promise you that it'll be time and money well spent.

I've been looking for a place to have coffee and read my books peacefully, good thing i found this place. They have free internet and delicious snacks. Great place to study. It's like a coffee shop without the noisy people beautiful everyones studying too","Frequently Asked Question:

Terrin S.","I'm told that Crying Tiger was from the same folks who brought us El Chupacabra on Polaris St., so I had an idea of what to find when I can down here: a chill, easy going hang out place with good food and cheap beer.It's a bit hard to find since its hidden on a side street behind Fersal Hotel , which is just in front of A-Venue mall. Just keep walking and you'll be greeted by the smokey grill, colorful lights and Makati's foodie crowd. As soon as I stepped inside, I already knew I was going to like this place. It's like El Chupa only cleaner, less dingy and has more of a beach bum kind of feel. (I think it's the wooden floorboards and colorful lights.) The only thing I didn't like, maybe was the fact that they kept on asking if I had ordered yet, or if there was anyone with me. (Which I get, since they're busy and I'm all alone at a table, but I had already explained that I was waiting for more people, which they seemed to forget.) On to the food: if you don't like anything spicy or flavorful, this place is not for you. Seriously. Their chicken is AMAZING. I love their spicy kangkong (doused with oil though), which pairs well with their fried rice.  They've also got a large selection of cocktails and wine, apart from the normal beers. (I got lychee cocktail! Pretty yum.)Definitely coming back and making this a regular hang out! It's cleaner, newer, and is better ventilated than El Chupa.

Location & DirectionsThe street faces the A Venue entrance with Domino's Pizza and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. (on foot) From ""A Venue"", cross Makati Ave, walk along Guanzon, and you'll see the restaurant on your left.RestaurantI expected it to be warm since it's hole-in-the-wall but it's kinda breezy during the evening, making our stay relaxing. The dine-in space is limited with a few seats outside but they have a bar, high chairs and all.Morning Glory with GarlicThis one is typical veggies. It's okay to have for mixing things up but I won't really look for it.Thai Basil ChickenWe liked it enough to get an extra order. We shared but each order is already a meal for one person.Thai Stir Fried Glass NoodlesThis is their Pad Thai. It's good but not the best I've had just yet.ServiceIt was quick up to taking care of the bill.

Such a welcomed find when looking for a place to grab some late dinner and a drink walkable from my hotel. I asked for some recommendations for a drink and food that had spice. Had a lemongrass, lime and Thai basil mojito. Tasty and actually paired well with the food. I got a rice dish called Gabi Pad Ka Prao (Thai basil chicken); has great flavor although a bit more salty than necessary. I also had the Pad See Ew (Stir fried wide noodles with chicken); this was spiced perfectly, probably one the absolute best Thai dishes I've had.

Crying Tiger Street Kitchen is one of Poblacion's ever favorite hole-in-the-wall Southeast Asian cuisine restaurants that will take you back to the street market food stalls of Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. A bit hidden on P. Guanzon, the street directly facing the frontside of A.Venue Mall, this restaurant is widely known among the neighborhood, but could be easily located on an online map.Dining was an easy breezy as the dishes are described in the updated menu spread with photos of their best-selling items. We had their famous Mee Goreng, Beef Rendang, and Thai Iced Tea.Our food was served in less than 15 minutes, considered fast for table-service restaurants. Calling the attention of the service crew, asking for recommendations, and ordering were all easy. Most service crews were welcoming, though we encountered one who just grabbed the menu spread and the tissue rack off our table when we were still dining. We didn't mind, but it could have been much more courteous if she spoke with us and asked for permission, as we were still eating. Also, the music could have been much softer to preserve the relaxing vibe, because it was hard to hear my companions when we were chatting, to the point that we had to shout at each other.Their Mee Goreng was full of ingredients and a plate could serve up to two to three people--but less in seafood. I mean, what's a ""spicy seafood noodles"" without much spice and just a few pieces of seafood? It was flavorful and a bit on the sweet-spicy side, may be catering to Filipino tongues that are used to the sweet palette.Beef Rendang, their take on Malaysia's spicy beef curry, was an instant favorite. The meat in the dish generously spicy and soft that it tasted like it was braised slowly and carefully. With rice, the dish can only serve and would leave you wishing you'd have more.The Thai Iced Tea was the spice quencher, if it suddenly feels hot when eating both the Mee Goreng and the Beef Rendang.Crying Tiger is definitely a must-visit in the area if you crave for Southeast Asian dishes, but make sure to get a table before groups go in around dinnertime as it gets full with avid patrons.

I've written 2 Yelp reviews before this one, both 5 star (jm a positive guy!), but my experience here was so bad, and the attitude of the staff was so ""could not give a f*@k,"" I cannot let it pass. Although it seemed sort of busy on a Tuesday night, I was seated fairly quickly, but then ignored for over 10 minutes before I flagged someone down to serve me.  I ordered a single pork skewer as a starter, the pad see ew as my main, and a beer.  I kid you not, the pad see ew was slapped on my table less than 90 seconds later ... uh that's way too fast for me to believe it was not just reheated slop, which is exactly what it was.  There were almost no noodles, and the stringy pieces of chicken were swimming in a soupy mixture of ... whatever.  While the flavor was not bad, it was texturally disgusting. I get it, you're busy and missed the mark.  I expressed my disappointment at the food, and explained you cannot serve your guests that fast, and not make them suspicious ... I've worked in many restaurants, so I always try to give benefit of doubt.  I asked what could be done about it, and said I didn't think I should have to pay for such a poor attempt; my server was extremely confused and just took off.  I assumed they just forgot about my pork skewer starter, but it finally did arrive a good 10 minutes after my main.  It was good enough. I was then ignored for over 15 minutes!  That is not exaggeration, I timed it.  The place is not big, my server (and many others) walked by several times ... it seemed like they understood they screwed up, but just did not want to deal with it.  Finally, I had to actually grab my server to tell him I would pay for my beer and skewer only; I left the money on the table and just walked out. I'm sure it's normally not that bad ... probably even good, but there are so many amazing options around here, I'm scratching Chupacabra off my list too.

The Mabantas of Makati are unstoppable!!! The folks behind El Chupacabra, Senor Pollo and Mexicali have done it again with a spanking new concept that is bound to be yet another hit among the young crowd. Crying Tiger is their stellar homage to Southeast Asian food, and it is something that I would love to come back to over and over again. I love my Southeast Asian food. Having spent some time in Indonesia, I have grown to love familiar flavors that really remind me of lovely combinations of spices, fresh ingredients and simple preparations. When I heard that they have mee goreng, albeit the Malaysian kind, I got super excited. Their fried seafood noodles have that awesome balance of spiciness, sweetness and sourness. Order a serving of fried egg with it. I also tried the chicken curry, which was superb.The food is yummy, the beer is cold, the prices are affordable for Makati standards, and the service is great even if they are still on soft open.

Good food, tried the Char Siu Pork Plate. Good ambiance. To nit-pick, the utensils used seems very cheep. It doesn't compliment the aesthetic of the place. Anyways, the most important factor os the tase of the food, which is otherwise goos.

My biggest issue with buying Asian Street food in Manila is how expensive it gets once you prepare it here. I mean, come on, why is Satay retailing for P100/stick? It's chicken on a stick with peanut sauce! And don't get me started with Pho, Roti, and Bahn Mi!So imagine my delight when I saw a new ""hole-in-the-wall"" type Thai place open up in Poblacion, Makati. The name alone (Crying Tiger) gave me an inkling that this place was irreverent and had a sense of humor. I was not mistaken. The joint itself was not going to wow you with their brilliant interiors, and I think that was the point. While there are splashes of inspiration here and there, the place looks like an artsy carinderia. Even the food is not presented all artsy and stuff, and that's the beauty of it! Because once you bite into their Fried Chicken or their Thai Barbeque (Marinated with Coconut milk), you will swoon. YOU WILL SWOON. And it's incredibly cheap too!Okay, I got so hungry typing this review that I'm going back there right now.

Ok truth be told, I'm really not big on Thai food. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine at a Thai restaurant because it's just not my preference...for some odd reason (same goes with Korean cuisine). Anyway! I ended up at Crying Tiger for a boss' despedida for drinks and heavy midnight munchies...or meal. We left the ordering to our boss and I'm surprised to even say that I was about to hit a food comatose. The food was so, so simple yet packed with flavour. I never really appreciated Thai flavours until today. Wew!The place was pretty packed for a late Thursday night, but we were luckily able to seat ourselves. Service was pretty fast considering that 1) we ordered A LOT and 2) it was about 20 minutes before last call. I really can't believe I'm saying this, but the food was so good that I'm most likely going to drag my friends there one of these days. The ambiance was so so. The bathroom look a lot better than the main floor itself. Parking wasn't really a problem. The only downside to it was that the beer wasn't that cold..and that's kind of a big deal for me because the first thing I usually ask for in a restaurant is their beer availability.Overall experience is def a 4.5/5 and I'm definitely coming back!

We order the spring rolls, Malaysian chicken curry, and Thai basil chicken. The spring rolls were good and fun with a surprise roll having a pepper. (We were properly warned by our server). The Malaysian curry chicken and basil chicken were delicious. The server recommended the basil chicken and we were not disappointed!","Frequently Asked Question:

I'll definitely be back!""    I had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant to others.

One of the best ramen I've ever had! Glad my cousins took me here. We came toward the end of the night but it was still quite packed! Just shows how good the food is. We were able to ""pre order"" while waiting so as soon as we sat down, the ramen shortly followed. I ordered the tantanmen and wow! It was so creamy, delicious and bursting with flavor. We also ordered the shoyo and miso and all were extremely flavorful and rich. I loved it. Ambiance reminded me of Japan as we all sat side by side in a wrap around bar. Next time I'm in Makati, I am definitely stopping by!

Must Visit! Ordered: Miso Ramen & Gyzoa. Hands down one of the best ramen spots I visited in Makati.Highly recommend going early and hungry seating is limited, and the portion is generous. After reading all the reviews I made sure to be there within 15 minutes of opening.Upon arrival, you are required to show your vaccination card - hard copy or digital. You'll then be sent to the cashier to place your order. The best part is you can watch from the boat-shaped kitchen counter your meal being prepared. The menu is straightforward. The most popular and what I had was the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen.  Other options:* Tsukemen cold noodles are separate from the broth. * Maze Soba - dry noodles served with a thick sauce.* Hiyashi Ramen, commonly loaded with vegetables and meat All best paired with their delicious Gyoza.  This miso soup was light on the palate but bold in flavor. Noodles were a perfect balance of firm and chewy. Topped, with tender cuts of smoked chatsu slices. You are left with such a lingering sense of satisfaction once consumed. You'll be planning your next visit right after. Note: Customers can choose their spice level.You can find better-priced ramen around the city but this is worth every penny. Overall, great taste, presentation, and service is quick. Mi

Worth the wait! There was a long line and their process from taking orders, paying and receiving orders were efficient!! Ramen was superb! Sarap!! Oishi!

Mendokoro Ramenba in Makati is a must-visit spot for ramen lovers. This authentic Japanese restaurant serves up some of the best ramen in the city. Their menu is small but carefully crafted, focusing on quality over quantity. The rich and flavorful broth, tender pork slices, and perfectly cooked noodles are all standout elements of their dishes. The ambiance is cozy and intimate, with a traditional Japanese feel. Although there can be long queues, the wait is worth it for the satisfying and delicious meal.

Delicious food! Other 5 star reviews don't steal you wrong- definitely go to heat here!

One of the best ramen bars in the ph. Mahaba ang line and medyo matagal ang waiting time. But I believe, gugutumin ka niya para lalo mo ma appreciate anb soup. My personal favorite is tantanmen of course

Got the Buta Kwkuni Ramen, delicious. Perfect blend of rich spicy broth and sweetness from the smoked pork. Definitely filling with its thick noodles

Best. ramen. in. Manila.That is definitely a heavy-handed claim given how popular the savory noodle dish is out here, but Mendokoro Ramenba holds its own amongst the competition.It's easy to make comparisons to the competition--Nagi, Ippudo, Santouka, and even options a price bracket down like Kuroda, but the presentation, taste, and consistency put Mendokoro one step above the rest.If you come here during normal lunch or dinner hours, prepare to wait. The dining room itself is centered around their show kitchen and there are probably only about 20-odd seats available. The dining room itself is pretty sleekly appointed with lots of warm Instagram-friendly lighting and nice wood textures. You pay ahead of time and then patiently wait for your turn. As with most other ramen places in this price segment, there is absolutely no take-out allowed, probably so cunning fans can't reverse-engineer their broth. Service here is amazing. The waitstaff and cooks are all super courteous and high-energy, seemingly unphased by the never-ending throngs of hungry fans. My water never dipped below half-full for the entirety of my meal, a considerable achievement considering how busy it is here.Now for the food. I recommend getting the gyoza to accompany the ramen. It's one of the best ones I've had outside of Japan!! It's pillowy-soft on the inside yet still with that perfect crisp on the outside. The flavors are delicate--not too salty, not too scallion-y. The umami is amazing.The ramen is amaaaaazing!! Anything on the menu is sure to please but my favorites boil down to the shio ramen and the tantanmen. While I feel as though the tantanmen could benefit from more meat, the broth and noodles are excellently done. The fact that the food is prepared in front of you is also a huge benefit.I do leave you with one warning though--this is not a ramen place to lounge around and make tambay with your barkada. You do feel a sense of urgency to get your ramen, enjoy it, and go since tons of people are waiting and the service is so speedy. Also, if you come with a large group of people, there's a real chance you won't be seated together. But for how good their ramen is, that's a small price to pay.

I am a huge fan of Ramen even though I don't eat it often. The place is small and cozy. You're sitting on stools next to people. They cook the food pretty fast which is great! The broth is kinda creamy and very flavorful. Ramen comes with veggies, a slice of meat (pork) and an egg. The bowl it comes in is pretty big. If one slice of meat isn't enough you can order a side of pork slices. The pork was tender and juicy which I was very pleased with. But here is why I can only give the place 3 stars. The place opens around 10:30. I got there at like 11. Because it's popular and seating is very limited, I had to wait about an hour. The place is small too so most of the waiting took place outside in the heat (not great). The food was good but I don't think anything is really worth an hour wait. The bowl seemed to be mostly broth. So if you feel full it's probably from the broth.","Frequently Asked Question:

The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. I would definitely come back!the food was delicious and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  i was so admire and so happy, the ambiance was so great.

The place is really cute and trendy. It has a very nice home. Feel to it. I thoroughly enjoy the bar area as it styled very nice. The restaurants lower level is very clean and modern. However, the tables are a bit close making it a little uncomfortable to get through. The upstairs is very intimate and quaint the back patio seems to be the most popular if you can get past the humidity.They have a decent wine selection, and the cocktails seem fun, but haven't been my personal favorite. The food also has quite a bit of variety, making it hard to choose but there's pretty much some thing for everyone. I was just not a fan that everything came with either rice or pasta or potatoes. I try to eat low carb, so it was a little bit of a challenge. I ended up going with the hanger steak, but it was not , my favorite sometimes the food lacks a little bit of flavor but that's probably just personal taste. It's definitely a nice choice in comparison to the options in town and worth checking out.

Often, during my travels in the United States or overseas, I've been asked what is the best restaurant in the city that I am in? I think I have found one for Manila in the Philippines.  Blackbird if not the best, is amongst the best restaurants in Manila.Blackbird is an Asian fusion and modern European restaurant. Its menu is diverse with and enticing list of dishes. Problem here is which ones do you choose? We visited for lunch and started with the beet salad, then the quail scotch eggs, followed by the lamb kofta balls. The main dish was Kerala fish curry.  How was the food? The beet salad had nice color, and a very fresh taste. The scotch eggs were made with shrimp, something unique, and arrived at the table with an enticing presentation on betel leaves, with coconut chili sambal. They were delicious. The lamb kofta was moist superb flavor, a good charred taste and appearance, and melted in your mouth. The Kerala fish curry was made with a meaty white fish, in a silky yellow coconut curry.  This dish came with papadum, green chutney, mango chutney, and basmati rice.  Another popular hit on their menu.So is the food alone enough to make a restaurant five stars?  I would say no.  During review, we have to count the ambience, the service, the table settings, and the background music.  In all these departments blackbird deserves five stars. They provided fresh plates and cutlery for every dish that arrived at our table, a rare table service, but a gesture that elevates the dining encounter to another level.  The music was an eclectic mix of jazz and European.  The whole experience at Blackbird was exhilarating and a culinary treat to the taste buds and all the human gastronomic senses.

We had a great time dining here. Reservations was smooth and organized, the host was amazing. Serving staff was friendly, attentive and gave tips about the food. The restaurant is beautiful in a minimalist way. Definitely a nice go to for special occasions or definitely for that nice, fancy date night :) will definitely visit again. Good portions are great for sharing. Drinks are flavorful- not strong. If bartender can find the middle point it'll be allPerfect!

Great and quick service. Love the ambiance. Food portions and quality very good . Must make reservations!

Excellent dinner , three 3 generations all satisfied. Great service, chilled wine didn't stop coming, loved all the appetizers and every entree was beautifully presented.

Gorgeous restaurant in a restored building in the heart of Makati CBD. I've always seen this place on social media and have been curious as to why it is so popular. As you enter, you'll see the bar on your right and a seating area on the left. The vibe is airy and sophisticated yet warm and inviting. Once you enter the dining area, you'll see their iconic table with a huge flower arrangement that showcases and complements the high ceilings and exposed beams. Love the natural light filtering through the restaurant when we had lunch at Blackbird. I've heard mixed reviews about their food and honestly, I agree that their food is gorgeous and photogenic but a bit overpriced and taste is so so. Dessert was mixed reviews too -- their sticky toffee pudding seems to be reheated in the microwave as it was a bit dry and lackluster. The baked alaska was wonderful though and I enjoyed that over the sticky toffee. Service was great and they were very personable.Overall, I'm just glad that I've finally tried Blackbird just so that I can tick it off my list.

Great atmosphere both inside and outside dining area. Such a good variety of offerings on their menu. Service is exactly what I am accustomed to, coming from Las Vegas, NV. It was so good that I went back a second time. The only hiccup was the service experience the second night. I think they forgot about us when we were seated outside. I did speak with an assistant manager to bring it to his attention, which he rectified. Will definitely go there again.

Place is beautiful! You can do either indoor or outdoor dining, just make sure you call ahead and reserve a spot because they get booked a lot during weekends. Ordered lots of food here and the best would probably be the tuna poké. You should try the mushroom cappuccino soup and the pumpkin soup; they're both cooked and warmed perfectly. As for the main, I ordered their special for the day which is the sirloin steak. It was just okay for me though, seasoned good but not perfect. Overall, I had a really good experience here.

Amazing food here. Make reservations beforehand. A great selection of food and the portions are just right. Great place for a date or family celebration. Plan ahead because it can be very traffic and difficult to get here.","Frequently Asked Question:

I am in Manila alone for business and wanted to try some local food.I started with the baked mussels with cheese and had the Bistek Ostrich with garlic rice for my main meal. The mussels were amazing! Never had them like that and they came with a spicy vinegar dipping sauce. A healthy portion of rice and an ok amount of Ostrich. I just had water to drink but there was a fun drink menu with some interesting options. I sat inside, but there is an outside seating area and a nice well stocked bar out there too. Only 4 stars because they never came back to fill up my empty water glass and it took a while to flag someone down for the bill despite it not being that busy. Good food, I'd go back, but be patience.

So this place has crab with a choice of sauces to include black pepper sauce.  They also have a seafood platter with crab, shrimp, and squid in sweet chili sauce.  Not a fan of the Chilli sauce so asked if they can prepare the seafood platter using an alternate sauce like perrer sauce.  This throughly confused the waitress who called a manager who then explained the seafood platter was already mixed with sauce even before it's ordered.  I am sure that is not the case. So asked if the chef could accommodate the simple request.  He could not.  Staff here obviously does not understand how to think outside the box.Ended up ordering shrimp sinigang, which lacked flavor and had small shrimps.  Ultimately, I would not recommend this place.

We ate at Manam two days in a row, and wanted to try other restaurants in Greenbelt. I saw Edna G's review of this place, so we decided to try this place. It was a warm and (a little too) humid afternoon for me, so we waited for a few minutes to get a table indoors. We ordered a bunch of dishes. Might have been one too many as there were only two of us! We ordered the Tinapa Eggrolls, Mango Salad, Crispy Pata, Grilled Bangus Belly on Banana Leaves and Garlic Rice. The eggrolls were interesting. I like Tinapa but I don't know if I like it in an eggroll. Better to stick with pork and shrimp, or vegetables for eggroll fillings. The Salad was great. It was a small portion but nice and bright flavors. The Bangus Belly was good and so was the garlic rice. The star was definitely the Crispy Pata! It was so good. Really crispy skin, tender meat and very garlicky! Loved it. Of course we didn't get to eat much of it since we had all that other food. The moral of this story is to just order the Crispy Pata and Garlic Rice if there's only 2 of you. We couldn't really take the leftovers with us as we were flying the next day to a different island.We had no room for dessert, so we didn't get to try any of their desserts. Next time. Food timing and service were both good. Even though it was 3 pm, it was still quite busy.  But then we ate there a few days before Christmas. Busy season for sure!!

Eats: Sinigang na Salmon Head, Inihaw sampler, crispchon, and liempo Takes: Of all the Filipino restaurants in the Philippines, Mesa was one of the most memorable ones for me mainly because of their lechon done 2 ways. One of the ways was in a wrap similar to a mini burrito. Inside this green pandan wrap is the lechon (pork), cilantro, and jimica paired with your choice of dipping sauce. The second way is your traditional chopped lechon. I literally would go here just to have their Crispchon served in a wrap. Service: Attentive. If you need anything, someone is always there within the vicinity.Wait Time: If possible, go during ""off hours"" or make a reservation beforehand to minimize your wait. If you go during peak hours, your wait time can be at least 45 mins/over an hour. Note: Even with a reservation, expect to still wait. During my most recent visit, we even opted to eat outside; otherwise, our wait time would've been an additional 30 mins for indoor seating.Mesa is popping for a reason! They have locations throughout the Philippines. Parking: shared parking garageBottom line: Go here for your Filipino fusion fix!Highly recommended.

I read on a foodie blog that Mesa Filipino Moderne was a place to try in Manila. It was highly recommended, so naturally it was the first restaurant that my mom and I ate on our trip to the Philippines. Mesa was located at one of the wings in Greenbelt 5. The entrance to the restaurant was outside, so Mesa wasn't accessible inside the mall. I definitely liked the decor and interior design. It stayed true to the Filipino ""kultura"" with a modern twist. Similarly, the food was Filipino fusion as favorite dishes were reimagined.My mom and I ordered the pomelo salad, sisig in a pouch, and Mesa braised beef to share between the two of us. I liked everything except the sisig in the pouch, which grosses me out even more now that I'm writing about it. My mom hated the pomelo salad, but I thought it was quite good. Admittedly the salad threw me off at first. I thought it was going to have lettuce or some type of leafy green... salad in the traditional sense. But nope, it was straight up pomelo chunks. The pomelo was too sour for my mom, but I thought that the ground coconuts and whatever other seasonings Mesa used in the salad actually cut the sour/bitterness of the pomelo.The Mesa braised beef was excellent! The beef was super tender and extremely flavorful from the sauce it simmered in. I could definitely taste strong coconut flavor, and I believe there was a slight hint of shrimp paste sauce. The braised beef paired very well with garlic rice. The sisig in a pouch was a sisig fried dumpling. I  noticed that some of the chopped sisig pieces had cartilage still stuck to the meat. Secondly, I caught a piece of sisig in my mouth that was pork skin still with hair. I was so repulsed by the bristly feeling of the pork skin hair against my tongue. I've decided that I won't eat pork anymore after today thanks to this experience. Lastly, customer service was so bad! There were like 10 employees bussing tables on the floor yet none of them stopped to help us or see how we were doing. We had to go out of our way to flag someone for assistance.

If I could give a zero star I would!! We ordered sisig, crispy pata, chicken with garlic and Laing.  Everything is either burned or over cooked except for the Laing.  The food is so horrible!! Don't ever go to this place.

Food:4 Service:4Solid restaurant that serves tasty food. I only came here once and got the mango salad, sisig, the braised beef, and the bbq meats. Seriously, the only food here I highly recommend is the braised beef. Super tender and full of flavor. The bbq platter was nice and simple. It wasn't overcooked and was just right. The other dishes were aiites. I'd definitely like to come back to try other dishes in future.

We went here for a quick lunch with my aunt but ended up spending 3 hours here. They had an issue with the AC but had plenty of coolers to help. The food is mostly fusion or a different spin on Filipino food. They had excellent choices and most of them are well done.Service was good.  They are attentive and we did not feel hurried during our meal. Mesa gets a high recommendation.

My relatives took us while my husband and I were on a business trip. The ended up reserving one of the large party rooms in the back for almost 20 of us. We didn't know what to expect but had heard they had really good Filipino food at this restaurant. Our private room was very spacious and luckily right next to the restrooms! My cousins ordered for our party and food just started coming out. I didn't know what the names of the entrees are but we got seafood, BBQ platter, lechon, chicken, duck 2 ways with different sauces, and fried leche flan (looked like mini lumpa).We ordered the bottle Filipino beers (Red Horse) which is a bit more stronger and hoppier than the San Mig or San Mig lite. My husband and I tried anything and everything. We had so much food!!! We also had leftover food to take home. The service as always in PI is awesome and very respectful. I don't know if they take reservations but I do recommend it since there is a lot of people who dine here. There are indoor and outdoor tables available and located in a busy mall.

If in the Greenbelt area, you have to try Mesa. It's in Greenbelt where all the other restaurants are outside the Greenbelt mall. This place is always crowded and I understand why. They are open late during the weekdays and weekends. They offer indoor and outdoor seatings, also made for large groups. They do offer filtered water service in slanted glasses. We ordered: Buko shake - a must and was only place that had it this as a shake. All other places never have it or run out. We asked if we could have this to-go and they said they had no container for it...Boo!Lychee shake - a mustPalabok - thin noodles - very good portion and very goodBoneless crispy pata - lots of fried garlic ...a must buy it was not boneless?Fried tilapia -cut up in small pieces and deep fried, comes with four sauces - a mustLiang two ways - very good portion and very goodBangus with black bean chili sauce - very good but not spicyBBQ pork sticks - was good but way too small. Picture looked bigger.Beware as it gets warm and humid in Manila so if sitting outdoors and at night, mosquitos will be there looking for those foreigner legs...hahaha. Customer service was awesome and always checked if we needed anything except at the end but I will be back...","Frequently Asked Question:

Their version was crispy outside but tasty and juicy inside. Service was tops, accommodating, friendly and fast.  The ambiance was pretty simple. No frills but clean and comfortable. Price over size plating was a average.  My 9 year old son even enjoyed their shawarma hummus.  Ohhh the baklava... delicious! Will definitely be back here just before we go back to Saipan.

This was my first stop on my trip! It was one of the only spots open late night! Thank goodness because it is delicious. It's also much healthier than the other late night choices. The hummus here is delicious! I also like that you can order half or full sizes of the falafel. The half size is fulfilling already. If you eat just those two things, you should be quite satisfied. My family comes to this place quite often! I can see why!

A good falafel is hard to find anywhere, but I was amazed to find a superb one in the Philippines. Located in Makati, it is a 24/7 late night establishment perfect for the munchies after a night drinking or just one good food. The falafels here are legit coming in half (3 falafel) or full (5) size order with veggies and pita bread. The white sauce and red sauce are perfect compliments to the falafels. The hummus is a must with the falafel. Definitely worth the extra charge.Service is quick and prompt always. It is on the pricier size, but the quality is worth it. Definitely coming back here for my falafel fix in the future.

Open 24/7, located inside A Venue Mall. Not exactly a place that stands out much since this mall isn't really popular. 190 pesos for their burger special, which was really good. Comes with fries. The burger doesn't have any sauce but the meat quality is really good and seasoned well. They give you sauce on the side that you can add onto your burgers. The burger was delicious. You can taste it with and without the sauce for comparison. They have a full bar as well.

Beni's Falafel had been a popular falafel place that my friends would tell me its the best. We happen to passby here just before going to Batangas on a wee hours of the day. I was surprised to findout it is open for 24hours.So, we ordered their usual feast. The Beni's Falafel Sandwich with addtional Hummus. The pita pocket was filled with 5 balls of falafel with shredded cabbage, tomato, and a spread of hummus underneath. The falafel has a nice, crispy crust with a soft, moist center. I love the crunch and the spiced flavor of it. It reminded me of a vegan burger because of how it was eaten and the filling. We regularly put their white sauce (not the sweet, garlic sauce). The white sauce has a nutty bitterness due to tahini that give it another kick of flavor. The hummus was nice and smooth. It was really good! Beni's Falafel is now top of my list for Middle Eastern cuisine.#TheFoodCrawlers #OngsFoodprints #TheLostDiego

I consider myself a Beni's loyalist since I first tasted his famous Falafel sandwich. Although I am an unapologetic carnivore, I always leave Beni's satisfied without craving for any type of meat whatsoever. I ordered the Shakshuka in July last visit. I was almost disappointed when the Shakshuka that was served to me was a bit drier than what I was used too and the egg on top was not runny (overcooked?) at all!  I took a chance and asked the server to change the plate because I don't like overcooked egg. They graciously took my plate back and came back with the perfect plate. The Shakshuka was as good as I the one Inhad back when Beni's was still in its old location across the street. The hot sauce and tahini sauce only served to take this dish up a notch higher. I will certainly be back soon to re-acquaint myself with Beni's other menu items.

MAZAL TOV - we have felafel in Manila! you can't get anymore authentic then Benni's he is, after all, Jewish! So everything he serves is Kosher - coz according to Beni, it doesn't get more kosher than him! Gone are the days of the old store (see across the street - it is still there) where the cramped dining often dissuaded curious passer-by's. Yup - new space, more seating, more TV's... So you can rock up at Benni's at anytime (open 24h) and expect a seat. THE FOOD - MUST TRY:- Felafel's (obviously);- hummus;- chicken liver meal sets (its like the adobo in Israel) - the pita - saladsDont count on delivery being a straightforward thing - often Benni's only delivers to Makati area and has a 1000peso minimum Shalom de Benni!

I am a big fan of falafels and kebabs and I only heard of Beni's Falafel while I was in the parlor in A.Venue and I got hungry. See, South Salon allows you to have food delivered so you don't go hungry while they dye your hair and give you treatments and relaxing massages.Anyway, so I said, okay, why don't I give it a try?I ordered a Beni's Falafel with additional hummus. When it arrived, I was extremely hungry that just the smell made me drool. I was like a vampire smelling blood while trying to control her blood lust.I opened the bag, there was a falafel sandwich with a siding of hummus. I quickly tasted the hummus and it was PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin. It was just right. The way a hummus should be. It was definitely love at first taste.Next, I fixed my falafel. I wanted to make sure that every bite would have hummus and garlic sauce on it. And ooh when I bit it for the first time, it was like I fell in love for the first time. It was like the first time I tasted ice cream. Or the first time I ever skipped rope. Or the first time I got an A in school.It was just amazing. Indescribable. I wish that Webster can create a new word so that I can better explain how I felt and what I tasted.Then I find out that it's open 24 HOURS. Well isn't that perfect for someone who works til late at night?

Is it really Arabian or Persian? Not that im really concerned, when the food is that good, who needs to put labels on them other than EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS? Beni's is really quite popular, even though it's hidden behind A-venue mall. I don't think the whole restaurant is around 10 sqm, but it still manages to attract people from all over the city. (And if you'd look closely, there are newspaper clippings and pictures of various celebrities visiting the restaurant!) Beni's is a literal hole in the wall-- could barely seat maybe 10-15 people maximum, and they get pretty full! Beni's falafel is famous for their... Well. Falafel. For those curious, falafel is made up from ground chickpeas (where your hummus came from) or fava beans that are deep fried and served in a variety of ways? And, it's also vegetarian! Hooray for my veggie foodie friends.  Fair word of warning: falafels are notorious for causing bloating and indigestion when consumed in large amounts (as do many other beans). It might be better to eat them in the morning and in moderate amounts. But really, how can you resist after a night of drinking out and when Beni's is open 24/7?? (Just be sure to drink lots of Yakult or  pair the falafels with some Lassi and you're good to go. )

This is a review that I've been waiting to write for a long, long time. A little back story: I'm obsessed with Middle Eastern food. So much so that I try to cook it often at home, and falafel is one of those dishes that I have never successfully managed to pull off, despite my best efforts. Thankfully, Beni's Falafel exists. I don't live in Makati, but I am easily lured there with promises of eating at this little hole-in-the-wall across A.Venue because it's just *THAT* good.BUT! Did you know that there's more to Beni's Falafel than JUST the falafels? I will skip talking about the Falafel sandwiches (which are amazing, and the other Yelpers have no doubt covered the bases already) and move on to the Hamutzim, which is basically a pickle platter. There's nothing like popping fresh olives, crunchy cornichons and a slice of zesty jalapeno into each bite of your falafel sandwich. Who knew that something already so divine could be elevated into a higher state of divinity with the Hamutzim?! I didn't.Also, their Chicken Liver with Onion is definitely one of the unsung heroes of Beni's menu. For those of you who aren't quite into liver, Beni's cooks it in a way that the weird aftertaste is almost virtually nonexistent. I suggest sharing this dish with a friend, and to add it to your falafel sandwich.My favorite time to come to Beni's Falafel is during off-peak hours. Sometimes if you go in the wee hours of the morning, you'll catch the people who have just descended from Gramercy, if you want to do a little bit of people-spotting.I love Beni's Falafel way too much, and I wish it was in QC instead of Makati!","Glad we went in this establishment. Food was amazing. We ordered almost everything in the menu and loved it all.  See pics. The falafel was not the usual try and over powering. Their version was crispy outside but tasty and juicy inside. Service was tops, accommodating, friendly and fast.  The ambiance was pretty simple. No frills but clean and comfortable. Price over size plating was a average.  My 9 year old son even enjoyed their shawarma hummus.  Ohhh the baklava... delicious! Will definitely be back here just before we go back to Saipan.

This was my first stop on my trip! It was one of the only spots open late night! Thank goodness because it is delicious. It's also much healthier than the other late night choices. The hummus here is delicious! I also like that you can order half or full sizes of the falafel. The half size is fulfilling already. If you eat just those two things, you should be quite satisfied. My family comes to this place quite often! I can see why!

A good falafel is hard to find anywhere, but I was amazed to find a superb one in the Philippines. Located in Makati, it is a 24/7 late night establishment perfect for the munchies after a night drinking or just one good food. The falafels here are legit coming in half (3 falafel) or full (5) size order with veggies and pita bread. The white sauce and red sauce are perfect compliments to the falafels. The hummus is a must with the falafel. Definitely worth the extra charge.Service is quick and prompt always. It is on the pricier size, but the quality is worth it. Definitely coming back here for my falafel fix in the future.

Open 24/7, located inside A Venue Mall. Not exactly a place that stands out much since this mall isn't really popular. 190 pesos for their burger special, which was really good. Comes with fries. The burger doesn't have any sauce but the meat quality is really good and seasoned well. They give you sauce on the side that you can add onto your burgers. The burger was delicious. You can taste it with and without the sauce for comparison. They have a full bar as well.

Beni's Falafel had been a popular falafel place that my friends would tell me its the best. We happen to passby here just before going to Batangas on a wee hours of the day. I was surprised to findout it is open for 24hours.So, we ordered their usual feast. The Beni's Falafel Sandwich with addtional Hummus. The pita pocket was filled with 5 balls of falafel with shredded cabbage, tomato, and a spread of hummus underneath. The falafel has a nice, crispy crust with a soft, moist center. I love the crunch and the spiced flavor of it. It reminded me of a vegan burger because of how it was eaten and the filling. We regularly put their white sauce (not the sweet, garlic sauce). The white sauce has a nutty bitterness due to tahini that give it another kick of flavor. The hummus was nice and smooth. It was really good! Beni's Falafel is now top of my list for Middle Eastern cuisine.#TheFoodCrawlers #OngsFoodprints #TheLostDiego

I consider myself a Beni's loyalist since I first tasted his famous Falafel sandwich. Although I am an unapologetic carnivore, I always leave Beni's satisfied without craving for any type of meat whatsoever. I ordered the Shakshuka in July last visit. I was almost disappointed when the Shakshuka that was served to me was a bit drier than what I was used too and the egg on top was not runny (overcooked?) at all!  I took a chance and asked the server to change the plate because I don't like overcooked egg. They graciously took my plate back and came back with the perfect plate. The Shakshuka was as good as I the one Inhad back when Beni's was still in its old location across the street. The hot sauce and tahini sauce only served to take this dish up a notch higher. I will certainly be back soon to re-acquaint myself with Beni's other menu items.

MAZAL TOV - we have felafel in Manila! you can't get anymore authentic then Benni's he is, after all, Jewish! So everything he serves is Kosher - coz according to Beni, it doesn't get more kosher than him! Gone are the days of the old store (see across the street - it is still there) where the cramped dining often dissuaded curious passer-by's. Yup - new space, more seating, more TV's... So you can rock up at Benni's at anytime (open 24h) and expect a seat. THE FOOD - MUST TRY:- Felafel's (obviously);- hummus;- chicken liver meal sets (its like the adobo in Israel) - the pita - saladsDont count on delivery being a straightforward thing - often Benni's only delivers to Makati area and has a 1000peso minimum Shalom de Benni!

I am a big fan of falafels and kebabs and I only heard of Beni's Falafel while I was in the parlor in A.Venue and I got hungry. See, South Salon allows you to have food delivered so you don't go hungry while they dye your hair and give you treatments and relaxing massages.Anyway, so I said, okay, why don't I give it a try?I ordered a Beni's Falafel with additional hummus. When it arrived, I was extremely hungry that just the smell made me drool. I was like a vampire smelling blood while trying to control her blood lust.I opened the bag, there was a falafel sandwich with a siding of hummus. I quickly tasted the hummus and it was PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin. It was just right. The way a hummus should be. It was definitely love at first taste.Next, I fixed my falafel. I wanted to make sure that every bite would have hummus and garlic sauce on it. And ooh when I bit it for the first time, it was like I fell in love for the first time. It was like the first time I tasted ice cream. Or the first time I ever skipped rope. Or the first time I got an A in school.It was just amazing. Indescribable. I wish that Webster can create a new word so that I can better explain how I felt and what I tasted.Then I find out that it's open 24 HOURS. Well isn't that perfect for someone who works til late at night?

Seriously! It might take quite a while for you to try them all but I undoubtly believe that you will enjoy your experience of eating here one way or another!Will definitely go back!

Very tourist-friendly food court for a foreigner staying in Manila! After my American tummy was getting homesick from weeks of kamayan and lechon fiestas, Hole in the Wall was there when I needed it. If you want pizza, fried chicken, and burgers (that taste good), with a fusion kick, it's there. Best to go in a big group so you can try and share a little bit of everything. My favorites were the Umami Chicken and Pork Shawarma. The cookie place was an interesting concept! If I find myself in Manila again, I know where to go if I have a homesick stomach.

Philippines review #36Located on the 5th floor of the Century City Mall in Makati, Hole in the wall has got to be one of THE BEST food courts I've been in!     yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…The best because the style / décor is very cool, modern and sophisticated.  It's casual and comfortable with a variety of different seating areas.yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…You'll find a variety of different food items to choose from at more than a dozen restaurants with fun names like: Bad Bird, Pho Bobo, Smokey Bastard, Serious Dough, The Beef, Scouts Honor, etc.yelp.com/biz_photos/hole…Of course there are a number of more formal, sit-down restaurants located in the mall.   But this is a fun, casual spot, with a variety of food served quickly and at reasonable prices!

One of the better food halls in Metro Manila today. They have carefully curated food concessionaires which offers great food experience. They currently have a pop up stall called Fire in the Hole that serves wickedly spicy grub that is simply awesome. I got their Fish Head Laksa and although it made me sweat, it made my tummy quite happy. Good thing they also have outstanding dessert cookies at Scout's Honor which helped to cool down the deliciously spicy experience with the Laksa.

The high-end food court has been a huge thing across the globe since the early 2010's, except in the Philippines. Back then, if you've been living in Manila for most of your life, the words ""food"" and ""court"" in the same sentence never really sounded appetizing.Enter Hole in the Wall. I've been here a few times already, but stepping inside its huge hip maze of interiors never ceases to excite me. I'm not sure if it's the thrill of choosing what meal to try next or just the nice aesthetic of literally everything, that excites me more.On my first visit, I made sure to first try the super popular fried chicken from Bad Bird. As a big fan Southern-style fried chicken, I wasn't disappointed. The crispy skin had a yummy seasoning that's new to the palette, very different compared to my other favorites, such as the Chickenjoy from Jollibee and the Pan Fried Chicken from Pancake House. And there's something about their side dishes that just completes the whole meal. The corn on the cob with bonito flakes, sweet and umami flavors melting in your mouth, was to die for. The coleslaw provided a nice acidic break from the saltiness of the chicken. The meal was a fun experience itself.Just the other day, I tried the Pastrami on Rye from Mr. Delicious and it was monstrous--just plain impressive in terms of size. I didn't even attempt to bite on the entire stack, using my fork and knife like a pretentious chick on a first date instead. Each bite off the monster-wich was packed with so many different flavors, though the pastrami still easily emerges as the hero of the dish. And let's not get started on the sweet potato chips. I'm not a big sweet potato-lover, but damn, the portion was more than satisfying. If there's anything I'd like modified, I just wish there was a bit more of the veggie pickles to cut through all the meat and fat.For now, I'll end this review right here. If it isn't yet so obvious, I'll probably be back here in no time to try a different food stall or two.

There are not much food choices here. Different restaurants that offers different cuisines. Foods are expensive and not so good. But the place is very spacious.

My jaw literally dropped upon arriving at this place.I couldn't understand what the fuss was all about when I first heard about Hole in the Wall... That was until I finally got to check the place out for myself. It's pretty much a ""cool kids"" kind of cafeteria. Well, to me, that's what it felt like. Really hip interiors, design, and furniture. I really like the fact that the servers roaming the area provide cold water, and extra place if needed. They also offer to wrap your unfinished food up when they've noticed that you are done eating. The choices of restaurants/stores here are of places I have not seen outside Century Mall such as Bad Bird (which sells the famous Umami Burger of theirs, and their corn on a cob is quite simple, PERFECT!), Scout's Honor, Posporo, Kwongs, Mr. Delicious, and many more! I've gone to Hole in the Wall more than four times, and I still need a bunch more visits to satisfy my curiosity with this awesome and quirky place.Seriously, I'm running out of money just wanting to try all the food options in Hole in the Wall.

Limited choices of food and kind of overpriced. Other than that, place is super clean and beautiful. Best food court I've been to.

""food court"" style place with great dishes. If you're in a bit of a hurry but want good food, check this place out. It's set up in the same way that the top floor of Japanese department stores are - once you get to the top of the mall you can meander through little food stalls that serve some really good food.  The place has a clean, relaxed ambiance and their staff is really helpful. Try the fish tacos at Posporo, any of the burgers at the beef, the umami fried chicken plate (with dirty rice) at Bad Bird, or make your own cookie at Scout's Honor. Fun place!","Frequently Asked Question:

Wonderful outdoor Saturday market. Fresh groceries, fresh prepared foods and some crafts. A great opportunity to try a lot of different foods in one place. Great prices!

Love all the home cooked pinoy food its only a few yards from my condo and when i am there i look forward to going. Got the best grilled food ever the pork, the chicken, the beef and the bangus. Its a must stop by.  Lots of other foods to as well. Goid for families a childrens park to. Salcedo village..i just love this area.

Great outdoor market every Saturday only. I make it a point to sVisit this market every chance I get. Over the years it just gets crowded due to its popularity with the locals and foreigners alike.Bring cash, some vendors do accept credit.

Its a little smaller than what I expected, but there is still more than enough to eat here. Many international food options. Since I'm just visiting, I tried to focus on the Filipino food... options mainly consisted of chicken/pork/skewers. Everything that I tried was fairly tasty (above average), and prices were very reasonable compared to similar markets in the US. There were also vendors selling produce. It was a little crowded, but not overwhelming. I believe that all places are cash only. Note it was impossible to get a Grab car back to the hotel, so I ended up walking.

There are two outdoors farmer's market in the area. Legaspi Village which occured on Sundays and this one, Salcedo Village Market that occurs on Saturdays. I love both these markets equally as each provides a little something the other does not. For me, I go to the Sunday Salcedo Market for freshly cooked breakfast and lunch food. For my needs there isn't much going on as far as fresh produce or small locally made knick knacks which is just fine. I'm really going for the ambiance, people watching opportunity, in a space that is a little larger and more widespread. I think the number of vendors here is larger than Legaspi, but again I come here for different reasons.Makati needs more outdoor markets! Support local.

There's something special about the Salcedo Market that keys me coming back. As Rafik's says, it's definitely habit forming. Whether it's the community feel, or the different aromas and flavours around, I look forward to the Salcedo Market every week. I love the culture and community here. It's a warm gathering, with many familiar faces and smiles. The Salcedo Market features more than 50 vendors, and everyone who comes here has there own favorites to come back to. A lot of the food here is made fresh and most are homemade and heirloom recipes. There are cuisines from all over the world, so you can have a taste of different international flavors as well as local delicacies. Salcedo Market is a place where locals and visitors can both enjoy a thriving community gathering, all with the common passion for good food and good vibes.

Nice crowd, good selections and reasonable price. Not as big as other weekend markets, which makes it great. Reminds me of the farmers' markets here in the US.

It's a must go place if I have friends visiting Manila. For myself, you will definitely see me there if I'm in town. No need to explain more, fresh vegetable, fruits, ginger beer, BBQ,.... you can find everything fresh here, but, with a expatriât price for foreigner.........Great place to hang our every Saturday in Makati!

Its like the counterpart of Mercato in BGC. Unlike Mercato, Salcedo Market opens at 6 AM in the morning and on Saturdays only. The place is situated in a park that makes it a place to bring your kids. I suggest you to here at 6AM so that you can get a headstart on checking all the products of the shops before it gets crowded. There's taho, burgers, shakes, lobster samdwiches, chinese cuisine you name it they have it. I recommend the lobster sandwich its at the center of the market place. Monster Burger was a good buy too and try the lamb shawarma.  You can buy water at the upper left of the place where the event coordinators sit.","Frequently Asked Question:

Everything was so good! It's one of those places where you can't go wrong with anything you order. It's dim sum, but without the carts being walked around. Prices are very very fair!I only got to eat here once while I was visiting the Philippines. Tim Ho Wan has now become a must-visit whenever I visit the Philippines again!

Very popular place but it was the worst dim sum I've had. I think people eat here for the name recognition.

Good tasty food, not so expensive, nice location,didn't have stomach ache . Bad part , 15-25 minutes wait for orders.

It's impossible to go here without ordering the Baked Buns. This is one of my favorite places to go when I crave for the baked buns. I've been able to try Tim Ho Wan in other countries.

Love the food , service and the ambiance . Very good Chinese resto . I always go back !

I always try my best to dine at Tim Ho Wan whenever I'm in Manila for their baked pork buns and vermicelli wrapped shrimp. Had lunch here on a Friday and the wait time wasn't so bad so we got seated in 10 minutes. Hubby and I ordered the following: baked pork buns, vermicelli wrapped shrimp, green veg with garlic, minced beef with egg on rice, shrimp and pork siomai and mango sago with pomelo. Loved everything we ordered and they've maintained the quality and standard of the food they serve. Even after a few months of not dining here, they still taste and look the same. My personal favorites were the pork buns - texture and flavour of the buns were great, vermicelli wrapped shrimp - love the sauce and the thinness of the wrapper and mango sago - can never go wrong with this!

It's out first time trying out TimHoWan and was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. This is an international chain specializing in Cantonese style Dim Sum. This chain originated in Hong Kong and earned a Michelin star. The portions are family style and perfect for sharing. This location was busy, however we didn't have any issues with the wait time. The menu was straightforward, pricing was cheap, and featured a lot of my favorite dim sum items. We ordered the fish cake laksa, prawn dumplings, pork dumplings with shrimp, jade wonton soup, baked bun with BBQ pork, steamed egg cake, sticky rice wrapped in taro leaf, and bean curd skin roll with pork and shrimp.Our orders were served within a few minutes. I noticed the lack off steam carts made the delivery process efficient. Out of all the dishes that we ordered, the laksa, prawn dumplings, and pork dumplings with shrimp were the standouts. The jade wonton soup and bean curd skin roll with pork and shrimp were a bit bland. The baked bun with BBQ pork was sweet and had a crunchy texture, which I really liked. The sticky rice wrapped in taro leaf was simply delicious. And lastly, the steamed egg cake was fluffy and not too sweet.Service was on point and our servers consistently checked in and refilled our waters. Seating configuration is a bit tight.

Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 3.0/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.0/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0Decent food, exactly what you'd expect at a THW.  It's a bit cheaper than locations in higher priced cities (d'uh).

Lol @ people complaining about the line here.Direct comparison to Tim Ho Wan at the HK IFC location:- Manila has more options to begin with, and doesn't run out of signature dishes few hours into opening- Manila has better food quality- Manila has way better service with no menopausal HK aunts running around- Manila has 4x the speed in getting you seated compared to HK IFC- Manila would have 15x the speed in getting you seated if there was a Tim Ho Wan in San FranciscoGet the shumai, baked bbq pork buns, lotus leaf sticky rice, and save the trip to HK.

Don't lean back in the chairs . . .Why? Because they really don't have seat backs. We walked by the one at the Mall of Asia probably 100 times & wanted to try it. We found ourselves in Glorietta and decided - - now's the time. It was a short wait, about 5 minutes. After being seated, we waited for menus. Little did we know that the placemats were the menus. We ordered four dishes:Beancurd skin roll w/shrimp: it's good. My only concern is the beancurd skin is so thin & fried that it was almost like a shrimp shell - - crispy. It's really good with the hot sauce.Poached Vegetables: outstanding. Here's the ""TIP"" - - ask for the sauce on the side; you can use it as a dipping sauce for other dumplings. Veggies cooked perfectly. Highly recommended.Pork dumpling w/shrimp: excellent. We dunked it in the poached veggies sauce, which was great. It's also good with the hot sauce. Steamed egg cake: my wife liked it. For me, it needed sweetness. Really, the whole thing is whether you like dim sum or not. If you do, you'll like it. For example, we were going to take my Brother-in-law to eat here a few days ago, but realized he wouldn't like it - - it's not his style. Service is a little slow, but we see that a lot lately . . . Not the cooking, the waitstaff & really there is no excuse for this. Last point, we ordered a pot of oolong tea; it was good, but I thought the pot was a little small - - differently no more than 2 people.Enjoy.","Frequently Asked Question:

My relatives took me to have lunch at this place.Their chef is from Barcelona whom we met after we ate.He serves an authentic gazpacho which I learned how to make in my recent trip to Madrid.  It tasted exactly the same.The Wagyu beef is not as tender as I know because I just recently had Wagyu in Japan.  The beef here is from Australia which I guessed!I like the ambience, the food and service.  A good place to have tapas Spain style.

If you're posh craving for Mexican food like tapas, then this place is indeed for you. Ambiance: 4 out of 5The interior is modern and classy, while the tables outside do not match the theme; they felt unsupervised and left out. The restroom is clean and spacious; very comfortable to do your personal thing.Food: 4 out of 51. Croquetes de Gambas con Alioli- super delicious! It's crispy on the outside yet very creamy and cheesy in the inside. I recommend you all to try that.  2. Rambla Salad- I expected a circus of flavors for this salad, but all I had was an ordinary salad.3. Spaghetti Bolognese- Delicious, very tasty, and generous serving4. Rambla's Mini Pizzas- Like their salad, these pizzas tasted just like plain breads splattered with meat and cheese. Sorry, but these pizzas will not bring you Mexico.5. Chringuito Sangria- Refreshing but without the umpf.Service: 3.5 out 5We agreed to take the table for 5 from 6pm to 8pm. Three hours prior our reserved time, we got a call telling us that we were going to be transferred outside; we agreed since most of the restaurants in Rockwell were fully booked. During dinner, I went inside and realized that there were still enough tables for us. Take note, these tables had been waiting from the time we got to the restaurant until we finished our dinner. Total score:3.6 out of 5Am I willing to comeback:No. Service to clients should always stand out.Good value for money:Maybe. Most of their food are for sharing, but they did not satisfy our hunger. Maybe we were famish during that time.

Between the wonderful ambiance, the relaxing vibe, and the exceptional tapas at Rambla, I've come back several times, and never failed to have a wonderful dining experience each time.There are some many wonderful small plates to try!  Both the suckling pig and the ricotta gnudi are wonderful; the cataalari bread is crispy, thin, and delightful (despite just a little too much bell pepper for my taste).Another dish that caught my attention as soon as I saw it on the menu was the Gambas on crispy chicken skin.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of the shrimps, and the way they contrasted with the crispness of the chicken skin.  Oh, and both the seafood paella and the chorizo are excellent!Bottom line: This is a great place to unwind after a hard day at work, or enjoy some drinks and tapas with friends.  It's also an excellent destination to head for when it comes time to celebrate a special occasion.I'll continue to return whenever I'm in Manila :-)

Rambla adapts itself to many situations - the after-work evening tapas, the splurge with your date, the group dinner where everyone has fun, and dinner spills into drinks. I happened to be with some of my best friends and their newborn baby. True, we got lucky securing the perfect table on the ground floor of their two-story resto, but in general I'd say Rambla had no problem accommodating us.It may look small as you enter, with tables laid out in an L-style layout around their open kitchen, but there is also room upstairs, where there's a brightly lit bar and an aged liquor cabinet, and slightly dimmer, more intimate lighting for diners and drinkers.Because the exhaust was admirably strong without generating extra noise, I think it's nicer to sit downstairs. A more casual setup along the bar counter looking right into the kitchen, great for solo diners, is possible, and there is room left for wine bottles chilling in their own wine bucket stand.And so we ordered away, because we craved pork, and we translated that desire into jamon iberico and cochinillo. We had mini pizzas with Iberico on top, as well as jamon Iberico croquetas; tiny chorizo Iberico ""baguettes"" filled with a chilled manchego cheese cream, 65°C eggs with potato foam and chistorra, and paella de cochinillo. We only deviated from script to get chipirones (baby squid) with BCN sausage (Barcelona sausage, I think, I can't track down more info about this), and beans.We thought we weren't going to get full, because Rambla portions are ""nouvelle,"" but we were wrong. (Please refer to the Refinery review I posted a few days ago; we went there and had almost no room left for their #awesomely #yummy bread pudding.)Can I just say I loved everything - and I mean everything - presented to us. If there was a way of chomping down dinner in an ""haute,"" civilized manner, I think we invented it. We ate at a leisurely pace, and in that leisurely manner scarfed away the croquetas, the ""baguetitos"" and the mini pizzas, dipped bread into the egg, sausage and potato ""foam"" and ordered more bread, and daintily spooned every bit of ultra-tender baby squid into our plates, while thinking, this deserves to be a main dish, could you serve this in portions three times this size, please. The sauce in the chipirones dish is one of the best tasting things I've ever had, to be filed away in permanent memory.Now, true: if we hadn't ordered cold and warm tapas, there is no way the paella would've been sufficient. They could add a bit more rice, in my opinion - one scrape, and you know the layer of rice verges on thin. Nonetheless: the baby cochinillo, while not as crispy as some might like, tasted perfect to me, atop richly flavored rice, spiced with a hint of cinnamon.I've previously dined with the same friends at Las Flores, their sister restaurant inside BGC, so there was no way they were going to let us down. With a couple of fruit shakes, no cocktails, and no dessert, our bill went a little over P1,000/pax, so P1,500/pax just for dinner is probably a good amount.We left sated and duly impressed.

Objectively meh. The soup and the beef tenderloin tapas were really good, but the shrimp was hammered and the squid looked like it was pulled out of the gulf oil spill. Combine with iffy service, and probably wouldn't return.

An upscale Tapas bar, Rambla serves up one of the best bone marrow dishes in the metro. Served with crusty bread, the Roasted Bone Marrow with Crispy Onion and Garlic Cream is as decadent and rich as it sounds. Trust me when I say it's not for the faint of heart. I first visited the place with three of my girlfriends for dinner and it's a great meal to share. With the bone split into two parts, there's more than enough marrow to go around. You can even request for more toast if need be. But apart from their main dishes, Rambla also serves up good cocktails. My personal favorite is the white sangria. It may look like the girliest drink in the room but it sure is potent! The price range of Rambla is far from your casual dining hangouts, which is why I prefer to head over their for special occassions. Whether it's a get together with your BFFs or dining with your significant other, the ambiance is cozy and intimate enough for good, long conversations.

Did you ever notice how suddenly there are so many Spanish restaurants popping up? Ironically, most of them are owned by the same people. The once Barcino, currently Las Flores group have now given us the latest and more modern Spanish restaurant, Rambla.Located in a corner by the side of the road, you will find a row of some of the hippest restaurants nowadays. The hippest and busies one of them all is Rambla. The design is not the typical and traditional Spanish look as they made it more modern with a black and white motif. I actually love the man walking logo that they used. They probably designed it this way so that it also acts like a nice bar or a place to hang out for afternoon drinks to happy hour even to 2 am drinking sessions. They have a very good selection of carefully crafted cocktails and wine. The only drawback is that they are quite expensive. A cocktail would already cost you P400 to P500. They change the menu once in awhile but everything they have served have been delicious! It's Spanish food with a twist. Their tapas menu is already good on it's own but what I would recommend trying are the Empanadas of Foie Gras and Pineapple Jam and the Foei Wagyu Burgers. I'm a sucker for anything with foie!

Because I used to have meetings all the time at the Nestle building right across, I'd seen Rambla a lot of times, and after seeing it pop up a lot on my feed, I decided it was worth a try.Online, there seems to be a big deal being made about their spherical olives, which are essentially pureed olives reshaped into olive-form, and made to sit in extra virgin olive oil. I didn't know what to expect, but when we tried it, it took a whole lot of effort to keep from ordering more: after all, Rambla had a lot more to offer us. But lemme tell you, that clean, very fresh taste stays with you.We also ordered their 65°C Egg with Potato Foam and Chistorra, which was interesting to look at but didn't really wow, and the Crispy Suckling Pig with Mustard Sauce and Bok Choy, which was as good as any pig I've ever had. But the star of the show for me was the Foie Gras Mousse with Caramelized Apples and Coffee-Baileys Foam. This was a whole lot of flavors happening one after the other, like Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody for your mouth. Too much foie gras usually gives me a headache, but man, did I want to keep eating this. I think you guys will, too.

Rambla is a cool restaurant set in Rockwell that servers Mediterranean Spanish food, specially Catalan dishes. Everything is so tasty and the ambience is so nice that I have lunch there almost every weekend.I always start with the Iberian Ham Croquettes or with their unique appetizer called Spherical Olives, which are marinated in extra virgin oil and literally melt on the mouth. The olives are all seedless and really enormous, with a different texture. This recipe looks just like magic! They are served on twisted spoons. Quite unusual, right? For the main dish I recommend the goat cheese hamburguer. Pair it with one of their signature drinks. My fave is a non-alcoholic one called Sicilian Limonata Almond and Lemon. It's a delicious combination of lemonade and almond flavor - you can actually see the almonds inside the drink. The ingredients blend into an explosion of flavor!   When you finish, you can try their desserts. But what I really recommend is crossing the street towards Powerplant Mall and getting a Xuxos at Churreria La Lola. The owners are the same - and so is the quality!","Frequently Asked Question:
